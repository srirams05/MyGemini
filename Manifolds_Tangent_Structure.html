    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Our discussion has covered the following key objects in
    differential geometry, focusing on smooth manifolds:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Manifolds:</strong> The fundamental objects,
    locally resembling Euclidean space but possessing a globally smooth
    structure.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Charts and Atlases:</strong> Charts provide local
    coordinate systems on a manifold, mapping open subsets of the
    manifold to open subsets of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. An atlas is a
    collection of charts that cover the entire manifold and whose
    transition maps are smooth, ensuring the smooth structure.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Space (<span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>):</strong> The vector space at
    each point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on a manifold
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, representing the space of
    directional derivatives or equivalence classes of curves through
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Cotangent Space (<span
    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span>):</strong> The dual space of
    the tangent space, consisting of linear functionals (covectors or
    one-forms) acting on tangent vectors.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Bundle (<span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>):</strong> The smooth manifold
    formed by the union of all tangent spaces, providing a smooth way to
    work with tangent vectors across the entire manifold. It’s a vector
    bundle.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Cotangent Bundle (<span
    class="math inline">\(T^*M\)</span>):</strong> The smooth manifold
    formed by the union of all cotangent spaces, analogous to the
    tangent bundle but using covectors. It’s a vector bundle.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Vector Fields (<span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>):</strong> Smooth
    sections of the tangent bundle, assigning a tangent vector to each
    point of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. They form a module
    over <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> and a Lie
    algebra.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Lie Derivative (<span
    class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_X\)</span>):</strong> The
    directional derivative along a vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, mapping smooth functions to smooth
    functions.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Lie Bracket (<span class="math inline">\([X,
    Y]\)</span>):</strong> A bilinear, antisymmetric operation on vector
    fields, satisfying the Jacobi identity. It measures the “failure of
    commutativity” of flows and defines the Lie algebra structure on
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Map (<span
    class="math inline">\(T_pf\)</span>):</strong> For a smooth map
    <span class="math inline">\(f: M \to N\)</span>, the tangent map at
    point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> is a linear map
    from <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)}N\)</span>. It maps equivalence
    classes of curves to equivalence classes of curves and represents
    the “best linear approximation” to <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Differential of a Map (<span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span>):</strong> For a smooth map
    <span class="math inline">\(f: M \to N\)</span>, the differential at
    point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> is the linear map
    from <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)}N\)</span> equivalent to the tangent
    map. It describes the action of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on tangent vectors at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Pushforward (<span
    class="math inline">\(f_*X\)</span>) and Pullback (<span
    class="math inline">\(f^*Y\)</span>):</strong> Operations that map
    vector fields between manifolds under a diffeomorphism <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, using the differential of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and its inverse.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Diffeomorphisms:</strong> Smooth, invertible maps
    between manifolds, which are crucial for relating geometric
    structures on different manifolds.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These objects and their interrelationships form a significant
    part of the foundation of differential geometry. Charts and atlases
    are fundamental for constructing the smooth structure itself. The
    tangent map and differential are crucial for understanding how
    smooth maps affect the tangent spaces.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth <span
    class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional manifold. Let’s
    describe the two ways to characterize the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Equivalence Classes of Curves Tangent at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Curves:</strong> Consider smooth curves <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> passing through <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>. We can represent these
    curves as maps <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i: (-\epsilon,
    \epsilon) \to M\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon
    &gt; 0\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(0) =
    p\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1,
    2\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Vectors as Velocities:</strong> The velocity
    vector of a curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is given by the derivative of
    its coordinate representation in a chart. If <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> is a chart around <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, with <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi(p) = 0\)</span>, then the velocity
    vector is <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(0) =
    \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ \gamma)|_{t=0} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.
    This velocity vector gives the instantaneous direction and speed of
    the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Equivalence Relation:</strong> Two curves <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> are considered
    <em>equivalent</em> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> if
    they have the same velocity vector in any chart around <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is well-defined because a
    change of charts induces a linear transformation on the velocity
    vectors, preserving the notion of “same velocity” (the Jacobian
    matrix of the coordinate transformation acts on the velocity
    vectors).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Space:</strong> The tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> is defined as the set of
    equivalence classes of curves passing through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, where equivalence is defined as
    above. Each equivalence class represents a tangent vector at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The velocity vector in a
    particular chart provides coordinates for this tangent
    vector.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Derivations at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Functions:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> denote the set of all
    smooth real-valued functions on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Derivations:</strong> A derivation at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a linear map <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p: C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>
    satisfying the Leibniz rule:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_p(fg) = f(p)X_p(g) +
    g(p)X_p(f)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(f, g \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span>.</p>
    <p>This rule captures the essence of the directional derivative:
    it’s linear and satisfies the product rule.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Space as Derivations:</strong> The tangent
    space <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> is defined as the
    set of all derivations at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
    Each derivation represents a tangent vector.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Connection between the two definitions:</strong>
    Given a curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> through
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, its velocity vector defines
    a derivation at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_\gamma(f) = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ
    \gamma)|_{t=0}\)</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This maps the velocity vector of the curve to a derivation; it
    acts on a smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by
    taking its directional derivative along the curve at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Conversely, given a derivation
    <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span>, one can show it
    corresponds to the velocity vector of some curve passing through
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
    <p>In essence, both definitions characterize the tangent space as a
    vector space of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
    (equal to the dimension of the manifold), providing different but
    equivalent perspectives on the concept of a tangent vector at a
    point on a manifold. The first uses geometric intuition of curves,
    and the second uses an algebraic approach focusing on the action of
    tangent vectors on functions. They are connected through the
    directional derivative.</p>
    <h1 id="tangent-space-using-curves">Tangent Space using Curves</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Next Question</strong> For the characterization of
    tangent space using curves, the tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(0) \in R^n\)</span>. This copy of
    <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> should be viewed as being
    ``attached’’ to the manifold at point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Is this correct?
    <strong>—————</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yes, that’s correct. The <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> in the curve definition
    is not an intrinsic property of the manifold itself, but rather a
    coordinate-dependent representation of the tangent space. We’re
    using a chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>
    around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to map a neighborhood
    of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to an open subset of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. The velocity vector
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(0) \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
    is then calculated using this chart. Different charts will give
    different representations of the same tangent vector in different
    copies of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
    <p>The crucial point is that the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> itself is independent of the
    choice of chart. The <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is simply a convenient
    tool – a “local coordinate system” – to represent the tangent
    vectors. The tangent space is abstractly defined as an equivalence
    class of curves, and only <em>after</em> choosing a chart do we get
    an explicit representation in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. So, while we use <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> for calculations, we
    should think of it as being “attached” to <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> via the chart, and the tangent
    space itself exists independently of this representation. The
    Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation handles the change
    of representation between different charts.</p>

    Space - Derivation and Directional Derivative</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p>****Next Question<strong> Please elaborate on your statement that
    a derivation as defined is similar to a directional
    derivative</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>——-</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s elaborate on the connection between a derivation at a point
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on a manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and a directional derivative.</p>
    <p>Recall the definition: A derivation at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span>, is a linear map <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p: C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>
    satisfying the Leibniz rule:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_p(fg) = f(p)X_p(g) +
    g(p)X_p(f)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(f, g \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Now, consider a directional derivative. In <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, the directional
    derivative of a function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R}^n
    \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> in the direction of a vector <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> at a
    point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is given
    by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(D_{\mathbf{v}}f(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla
    f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial
    f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{x}) v_i\)</span></p>
    <p>This is a linear operator on functions (linearity in <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>) and satisfies the Leibniz
    rule:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(D_{\mathbf{v}}(fg)(\mathbf{x}) =
    \nabla(fg)(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{v} = (f(\mathbf{x})\nabla
    g(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x})\nabla f(\mathbf{x})) \cdot \mathbf{v}
    = f(\mathbf{x})D_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{x}) +
    g(\mathbf{x})D_{\mathbf{v}}f(\mathbf{x})\)</span></p>
    <p>The key similarities between a derivation <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> and a directional derivative
    <span class="math inline">\(D_{\mathbf{v}}\)</span> are:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Linearity:</strong> Both are linear maps acting on
    functions. They both satisfy <span class="math inline">\(X_p(\alpha
    f + \beta g) = \alpha X_p(f) + \beta X_p(g)\)</span> and similarly
    for <span class="math inline">\(D_v\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Leibniz Rule:</strong> Both satisfy the product rule
    (Leibniz rule). This is crucial because it means they act like
    differentiation; they “distribute” across products in a way that
    mimics the derivative’s behavior.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Local nature:</strong> Both are defined at a specific
    point. The directional derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(D_{\mathbf{v}}f(\mathbf{x})\)</span> is
    calculated at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, and the derivation <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> acts on functions evaluated at
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The difference is that a directional derivative is defined in
    Euclidean space using partial derivatives, which are not directly
    available on a general manifold. A derivation provides an
    <em>abstraction</em> of the directional derivative that works on
    manifolds without needing explicit coordinates or partial
    derivatives. A derivation captures the essence of “directional
    change of a function at a point” in a coordinate-free manner. We
    then show that derivations are in one-to-one correspondence with
    tangent vectors defined via curves, giving us a concrete connection.
    The chart mapping gives us the link between the abstract derivation
    and the coordinate representation of the directional derivative.</p>

    <p><strong>——-</strong></p>
    <p>You’re right to point out the analogy and the shift in
    perspective when moving from <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> to a manifold. In <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\)</span> is a
    well-defined partial derivative operator acting directly on
    functions <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
    <p>On a manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we don’t
    have a global coordinate system like we do in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Instead, we work
    locally with charts <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: U
    \subset M \to \varphi(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is a
    homeomorphism. The function <span class="math inline">\(f: M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span> can be expressed locally as <span
    class="math inline">\(f \circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U) \subset
    \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. Then we <em>can</em> use
    partial derivatives:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial (f \circ
    \varphi^{-1})}{\partial x_i}\)</span></p>
    <p>However, this is still tied to the specific chart <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>. We’d like something
    chart-independent.</p>
    <p>That’s where the concept of a derivation becomes crucial. Instead
    of viewing <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x_i}\)</span> as an operator acting directly on <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we use it to <em>construct</em> a
    derivation at a point <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    U\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_i(f) = \left.\frac{\partial (f
    \circ \varphi^{-1})}{\partial x_i}\right|_{\varphi(p)}\)</span></p>
    <p>This is a well-defined number, giving us the rate of change of
    <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the <span
    class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th coordinate direction <em>at the
    point p</em>. Importantly, <em>X<sub>i</sub> is a derivation at
    p</em>. It’s a linear operator satisfying the Leibniz rule.</p>
    <p>The derivations <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, one for
    each coordinate, form a basis for the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. So, any tangent vector (and
    thus any directional derivative at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) can be written as a linear
    combination of these basis derivations:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_p = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i\)</span>
    for some <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in
    \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Therefore, instead of viewing the partial derivative operator as
    directly acting on <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we use
    the partial derivatives within a chart to <em>construct</em> the
    derivations which are then the fundamental objects capturing
    directional derivatives on the manifold. The derivations are
    chart-independent in that they represent a tangent vector
    irrespective of the choice of local coordinates, even though they
    are initially <em>defined</em> using a coordinate chart.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Next Question</strong> Now that the tangent space is
    defined, I want to discuss the tangent bundle. Each point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> has an associated tangent
    space <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. The collection of
    these tangent spaces can be organized into a tangent bundle. I can
    view this collection as a set but what more structure can be given
    to it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You’re right, the collection of tangent spaces <span
    class="math inline">\(\{T_pM\}_{p \in M}\)</span> can be organized
    into a structure called the tangent bundle, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>. Viewing it simply as a set is
    insufficient; it needs a lot more structure to be useful in
    differential geometry. Here’s how we equip it with that
    structure:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Set:</strong> The underlying set of the tangent
    bundle is indeed the disjoint union of all tangent spaces:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(TM = \bigcup_{p \in M}
    T_pM\)</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Projection Map:</strong> There’s a natural projection
    map <span class="math inline">\(\pi: TM \to M\)</span> which sends
    each tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(v \in T_pM\)</span>
    to the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to which it’s
    tangent: <span class="math inline">\(\pi(v) = p\)</span>. This map
    is crucial because it connects the tangent vectors back to their
    base points on the manifold.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Topology:</strong> We equip <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> with a topology. Several
    topologies are possible, but the most common and useful is the
    topology induced by the charts of <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Given a chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we construct a corresponding chart
    <span class="math inline">\((\pi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})\)</span>
    on <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> as follows: If <span
    class="math inline">\(v \in T_pM\)</span> for some <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in U\)</span>, then <span
    class="math inline">\(v\)</span> can be represented as a vector in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> (using the chart).
    The map <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}\)</span> sends
    <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\((\varphi(p), v_{\mathbb{R}^n})\)</span>, where
    <span class="math inline">\(v_{\mathbb{R}^n}\)</span> is the
    coordinate representation of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>
    in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. This
    essentially gives each tangent space local coordinates. This
    construction makes <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> a
    continuous map.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Manifold Structure:</strong> The most
    important addition is giving <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>
    the structure of a smooth manifold. The charts <span
    class="math inline">\((\pi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})\)</span>
    constructed above, with <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}\)</span> mapping to <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\)</span> (n coordinates for
    the base point and n for the tangent vector), precisely define this
    smooth structure. This makes the tangent bundle itself a smooth
    manifold of dimension 2n, if M is of dimension n.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Vector Bundle Structure:</strong> The tangent
    bundle is more specifically a <em>smooth vector bundle</em>. This
    adds extra structure beyond just being a manifold:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Vector Space Structure on Fibers:</strong> For each
    <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, the fiber <span
    class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(p) = T_pM\)</span> is a vector space
    (the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). The
    vector space operations (addition and scalar multiplication) are
    smoothly defined.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Trivialization:</strong> There exist local
    trivializations. This means that for each open set <span
    class="math inline">\(U\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, there is a diffeomorphism between
    <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(U)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(U \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> that preserves
    the vector space structure in the fibers. Essentially, locally, the
    tangent bundle looks like a Cartesian product of the manifold and
    its tangent space.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, the tangent bundle is much more than just a set; it’s
    a smooth manifold (with twice the dimension of the original
    manifold) equipped with a smooth projection map, a vector bundle
    structure, and local coordinate charts. This rich structure allows
    for powerful tools from differential geometry to be applied and used
    to analyze vector fields, differential forms, and other fundamental
    objects on manifolds.</p>

    <p><strong>Next Question</strong> In your step 1 above, you define

    the disjoint union. Is it not more precise to define <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> in terms of the pair <span
    class="math inline">\((p, v_p) | p \in M, v_p \in T_p M\)</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You’re absolutely right to point out the subtle but important
    distinction. While <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{p \in M}
    T_pM\)</span> represents the <em>set</em> of all tangent vectors, it
    doesn’t explicitly capture the crucial connection between a tangent
    vector and its base point. The notation <span
    class="math inline">\(TM = \{(p, v_p) | p \in M, v_p \in
    T_pM\}\)</span> is more precise because it explicitly represents
    each element of the tangent bundle as an ordered pair <span
    class="math inline">\((p, v_p)\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the point on the manifold and
    <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> is a tangent vector in the
    tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This
    notation makes the projection map <span class="math inline">\(\pi:
    TM \to M\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(\pi(p, v_p) =
    p\)</span> completely clear.</p>
    <p>The disjoint union notation <span
    class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{p \in M} T_pM\)</span> is often used
    as shorthand, but it can be slightly misleading because it doesn’t
    explicitly specify the relationship between the tangent vector and
    its base point. Your suggestion using ordered pairs is more rigorous
    and clearly defines the tangent bundle as a set. In a more formal
    development, the ordered pair notation is indeed preferred. My
    previous explanation emphasized building the manifold structure, so
    using the disjoint union notation simplified the presentation in the
    context of chart construction and other structure definitions.
    However, for a precise and unambiguous definition, the ordered pair
    notation is superior.</p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth <span
    class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional manifold. The tangent
    bundle <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is defined as the set
    of all pairs <span class="math inline">\((p, v_p)\)</span>, where
    <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p \in T_pM\)</span> is a tangent vector in
    the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(TM = \{(p, v_p) \mid p \in M, v_p \in
    T_pM\}\)</span></p>
    <p>This characterization immediately clarifies the relationship
    between a tangent vector and its base point. Let’s now describe the
    structure of <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Projection Map:</strong> The natural projection map
    <span class="math inline">\(\pi: TM \to M\)</span> is defined by
    <span class="math inline">\(\pi(p, v_p) = p\)</span>. This map sends
    each tangent vector to its base point on the manifold. This is
    explicitly defined and straightforward with this ordered pair
    representation.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Topology and Smooth Structure:</strong> To give <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> a topology and smooth manifold
    structure, we again leverage the charts of <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Let <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> be a chart on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is a
    homeomorphism. We construct a chart <span
    class="math inline">\((\pi^{-1}(U), \tilde{\varphi})\)</span> on
    <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> as follows:</p>
    <p>For any <span class="math inline">\((p, v_p) \in
    \pi^{-1}(U)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    U\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> can be
    represented by a vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> using the chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>. We can thus express
    <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> using coordinates relative
    to the basis given by the partial derivatives of <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>. This gives a coordinate
    representation of <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>. Then the
    chart map <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}\)</span> is
    given by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}(p, v_p) =
    (\varphi(p), v_p^{\mathbb{R}^n}) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^{2n}\)</span></p>
    <p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(v_p^{\mathbb{R}^n}\)</span>
    represents the coordinate vector of <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> relative to the chart
    <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>.</p>
    <p>These charts <span class="math inline">\((\pi^{-1}(U),
    \tilde{\varphi})\)</span> define a smooth atlas on <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>, making it a smooth manifold of
    dimension <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>. The transition
    maps between these charts are smooth, ensuring the smooth manifold
    structure.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Vector Bundle Structure:</strong> The ordered
    pair representation clearly shows that for each <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, the set <span
    class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(p) = \{(p, v_p) \mid v_p \in
    T_pM\}\)</span> is precisely the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>, which is a vector space. The
    vector space operations (addition and scalar multiplication) are
    defined pointwise:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((p, v_p) + (p, w_p) = (p, v_p +
    w_p)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(c(p, v_p) = (p,
    cv_p)\)</span></p>
    <p>These operations are smoothly defined with respect to the smooth
    structure we defined above using charts, making <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> a smooth vector bundle. The local
    trivializations are then also directly constructible from the
    charts.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, using the ordered pair notation <span
    class="math inline">\((p, v_p)\)</span> gives a more precise and
    intuitive definition of the tangent bundle. It clarifies the
    projection map and makes the construction of the smooth manifold and
    vector bundle structure more straightforward. The ordered pair
    representation makes the underlying structure clearer and more
    mathematically rigorous.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>You’re absolutely correct. Using <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}(p, v_p) = (\varphi(p),
    (d\varphi)_p(v_p))\)</span> is significantly better and more

    detail: how the tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> is represented in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Simply writing <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p^{\mathbb{R}^n}\)</span> hides the
    important role of the differential <span
    class="math inline">\((d\varphi)_p\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Here’s why your suggestion is superior:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Coordinate-Independent Definition:</strong> The
    expression <span class="math inline">\(v_p^{\mathbb{R}^n}\)</span>
    implicitly assumes a specific coordinate representation of <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> using a basis. Using <span
    class="math inline">\((d\varphi)_p(v_p)\)</span> explicitly shows
    that the vector <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> is mapped
    to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> using the
    differential of the chart map. This makes the construction of the
    chart map coordinate-independent and more geometrically
    intuitive.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Correct Transformation Behavior:</strong> The
    differential <span class="math inline">\((d\varphi)_p\)</span> is a
    linear map between tangent spaces <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{\varphi(p)}\mathbb{R}^n \cong
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. This ensures that the coordinate
    representation of the tangent vector transforms correctly under
    changes of charts on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Simply
    using <span class="math inline">\(v_p^{\mathbb{R}^n}\)</span>
    doesn’t explicitly guarantee this correct transformation
    behavior.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Geometric Interpretation:</strong> The differential
    <span class="math inline">\((d\varphi)_p\)</span> represents the
    best linear approximation of <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. It maps tangent vectors from <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> to tangent vectors in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> in a consistent manner.
    This aligns better with the intrinsic geometric nature of tangent
    vectors.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, the more precise and correct definition of the chart
    map <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}\)</span> on the
    tangent bundle is:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\varphi}(p, v_p) =
    (\varphi(p), (d\varphi)_p(v_p))\)</span></p>
    <p>My apologies for the oversight in the previous response. Your
    suggestion significantly improves the mathematical rigor and clarity
    of the definition. The use of the differential properly connects the

    <li><p><strong>Linear Independence:</strong> The derivations <span

    suppose that:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i

    <p>If we let <span class="math inline">\(f = x_j\)</span> (the <span

    at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Therefore, because the <span
    class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial

    </blockquote>
    <p>You’re right, we need to show that the set of equivalence classes
    of curves through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> forms a
    vector space. Let’s denote the equivalence class of a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> by <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span>. The equivalence relation
    is that two curves <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> are equivalent at
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> if and only if their velocity
    vectors in any chart around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
    are identical. Using the chart <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span>, this means:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ
    \gamma_1)|_{t=0} = \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ
    \gamma_2)|_{t=0}\)</span></p>
    <p>Now let’s define vector addition and scalar multiplication on
    these equivalence classes:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Vector Addition:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma_1]_p\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma_2]_p\)</span> be two equivalence
    classes of curves passing through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. To define their sum <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma_1]_p + [\gamma_2]_p\)</span>, we need
    to find a representative curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> such that its velocity vector
    is the sum of the velocity vectors of <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span>. We can do this locally,
    using the chart:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Coordinate Representation:</strong> In the chart
    <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>, the velocity
    vectors are given by <span class="math inline">\(v_1 =
    \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ \gamma_1)|_{t=0}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(v_2 = \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ
    \gamma_2)|_{t=0}\)</span>. These are vectors in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Sum in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>:</strong> Add these
    velocity vectors in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>: <span
    class="math inline">\(v = v_1 + v_2\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Lift to the Manifold:</strong> Find a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ \gamma)|_{t=0} =
    v\)</span>. This is always possible because we can construct such a
    curve locally in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
    and then use <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{-1}\)</span> to
    map it back to M.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then we define the sum of equivalence classes as: <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma_1]_p + [\gamma_2]_p =
    [\gamma]_p\)</span>. This is well-defined because if we use a
    different chart, the addition in the new coordinate system will
    still lead to the same equivalence class (linear transformation of
    the velocity vector).</p>
    <p><strong>2. Scalar Multiplication:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> be an equivalence class
    and <span class="math inline">\(c \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> be a
    scalar. To define scalar multiplication <span
    class="math inline">\(c[\gamma]_p\)</span>, we use a similar
    approach:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Coordinate Representation:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\(v = \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ
    \gamma)|_{t=0}\)</span> be the velocity vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Scalar Multiplication in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>:</strong> Compute <span
    class="math inline">\(cv \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Lift to Manifold:</strong> Find a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ
    \tilde{\gamma})|_{t=0} = cv\)</span>. This is always locally
    possible.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then we define scalar multiplication as: <span
    class="math inline">\(c[\gamma]_p = [\tilde{\gamma}]_p\)</span>.
    Again, this is well-defined due to the transformation properties of
    velocity vectors under coordinate changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Verification of Vector Space Axioms:</strong> With these
    definitions of addition and scalar multiplication, you can then
    verify that all the axioms of a vector space are satisfied. The zero
    vector is the equivalence class of constant curves through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and the additive inverse of <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> is given by <span
    class="math inline">\([-1][\gamma]_p\)</span>. The proofs of the
    axioms rely heavily on the properties of addition and scalar
    multiplication in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>,
    showing that the operations are well-defined and independent of the
    choice of representative curves within each equivalence class. The
    chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> is used only
    to provide a local coordinate system where vector addition and
    scalar multiplication in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> are well-understood.</p>
    <p>This demonstrates that the set of equivalence classes of curves
    through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, with addition and
    scalar multiplication defined as above, forms a vector space—the
    tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>.</p>

    <p><strong>New Question</strong> Next, we need to show the
    equivalence of the two characterizations of tangent spaces: via
    derivations and via equivalence class of curves. How to do this</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To show the equivalence of the two characterizations of the
    tangent space—derivations and equivalence classes of curves—we need
    to establish a one-to-one correspondence between them. Here’s how we
    can do it:</p>
    <p><strong>1. From Curves to Derivations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Curve defines a Derivation:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> be an equivalence class of
    curves through <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>. We can
    associate a derivation <span class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}:
    C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with this equivalence class as
    follows:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}(f) = \frac{d}{dt}(f
    \circ \gamma)|_{t=0}\)</span></p>
    <p>This is the directional derivative of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. It’s important to note that this
    definition is independent of the choice of representative curve
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> within the equivalence
    class <span class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> because
    equivalent curves have the same velocity vector at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Thus, the directional derivatives
    coincide for equivalent curves. This satisfies linearity and the
    Leibniz rule:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Linearity:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}(af + bg) = \frac{d}{dt}((af+bg)
    \circ \gamma)|_{t=0} = a\frac{d}{dt}(f \circ \gamma)|_{t=0} +
    b\frac{d}{dt}(g \circ \gamma)|_{t=0} = aX_{[\gamma]_p}(f) +
    bX_{[\gamma]_p}(g)\)</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Leibniz Rule:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}(fg) = \frac{d}{dt}((fg) \circ
    \gamma)|_{t=0} = f(p)X_{[\gamma]_p}(g) +
    g(p)X_{[\gamma]_p}(f)\)</span> (using the product rule for
    derivatives).</p></li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, each equivalence class <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> defines a unique
    derivation <span class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>2. From Derivations to Curves:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Derivation defines a Curve:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> be a derivation at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We need to show that there exists
    an equivalence class of curves <span
    class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(X_p = X_{[\gamma]_p}\)</span>. This is more
    involved and requires using a chart <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span> around <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Local Coordinates:</strong> Choose a chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> with <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi(p) = 0\)</span>. The components of
    <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> in the coordinate
    directions are given by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(v_i = X_p(x_i \circ
    \varphi^{-1})\)</span> where <span
    class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is the <span
    class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th coordinate function in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. This gives us a vector
    <span class="math inline">\(v = (v_1, \dots, v_n) \in
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Constructing the Curve:</strong> Now consider the
    straight line curve in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> given by <span
    class="math inline">\(\alpha(t) = tv\)</span>. We can then lift this
    to a curve in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> using the
    chart: <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) =
    \varphi^{-1}(\alpha(t)) = \varphi^{-1}(tv)\)</span>. Then we can
    show that: <span class="math inline">\(X_p(f) = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ
    \gamma)|_{t=0} = X_{[\gamma]_p}(f)\)</span>. This uses the chain
    rule and the property that <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span>
    is a derivation.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Equivalence Class:</strong> This <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> defines an equivalence class
    of curves <span class="math inline">\([\gamma]_p\)</span> such that
    its corresponding derivation <span
    class="math inline">\(X_{[\gamma]_p}\)</span> is equal to the given
    <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. One-to-One Correspondence:</strong> The mappings
    defined above are inverses of each other. Showing this formally
    requires some detailed calculations involving the chain rule and
    properties of derivations and curves. However, intuitively, it’s
    clear that each equivalence class of curves uniquely determines a
    derivation, and vice-versa. Thus, the set of derivations and the set
    of equivalence classes of curves are isomorphic.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we have established a one-to-one correspondence
    between the set of equivalence classes of curves through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the set of derivations at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, proving the equivalence of the two
    characterizations of the tangent space. The crucial step was using a
    chart to connect the coordinate representation of tangent vectors in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> with the abstract
    definitions of derivations and curves.</p>
    <h1 id="tangent-map">Tangent map</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>New Question</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(f:

    </blockquote>
    <p>To show that the tangent map <span class="math inline">\(T_p f:
    T_pM \to T_qN\)</span> is linear, we need to demonstrate that it
    preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Recall that
    <span class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> maps equivalence classes
    of curves in <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> to
    equivalence classes of curves in <span
    class="math inline">\(T_qN\)</span> by the rule:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p) = [f \circ

    the equivalence class of a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(c(0) = p\)</span>, and <span
    class="math inline">\([f \circ c]_q\)</span> is the equivalence
    class of the curve <span class="math inline">\(f \circ c\)</span> in
    <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> passing through <span
    class="math inline">\(q = f(p)\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Preservation of Vector Addition:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\([c]_p\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\([d]_p\)</span> be two equivalence classes of
    curves in <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. We want to show
    that:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p + [d]_p) = T_p f([c]_p) +
    T_p f([d]_p)\)</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Left-hand side:</strong> The sum <span
    class="math inline">\([c]_p + [d]_p\)</span> is defined using the
    velocity vector addition in local coordinates, leading to a curve
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> such that the velocity
    vector of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the sum of
    the velocity vectors of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Then <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p + [d]_p) = T_p f([\gamma]_p) = [f
    \circ \gamma]_q\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Right-hand side:</strong> We have <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p) = [f \circ c]_q\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(T_p f([d]_p) = [f \circ d]_q\)</span>.
    The sum <span class="math inline">\([f \circ c]_q + [f \circ
    d]_q\)</span> is the equivalence class of a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such that the velocity vector of
    <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the sum of the
    velocity vectors of <span class="math inline">\(f \circ c\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(f \circ d\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To prove the equality, it’s crucial to work locally. Use charts
    <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> around <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((V,
    \psi)\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in
    <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Then the velocity vector of
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (whose equivalence class
    is the sum <span class="math inline">\([c]_p + [d]_p\)</span>) is
    the sum of the velocity vectors of <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^m\)</span>, and the velocity vector
    of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the sum of the
    velocity vectors of <span class="math inline">\(f \circ c\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(f \circ d\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. The chain rule implies
    that the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps the
    velocity vector of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to
    the velocity vector of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.
    This demonstrates that <span class="math inline">\([f \circ
    \gamma]_q = [f \circ c]_q + [f \circ d]_q\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Preservation of Scalar Multiplication:</strong> Let
    <span class="math inline">\([c]_p\)</span> be an equivalence class
    of curves in <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> and let <span
    class="math inline">\(a \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> be a scalar. We want
    to show that:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f(a[c]_p) = aT_p
    f([c]_p)\)</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Left-hand side:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(a[c]_p\)</span> corresponds to a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> whose velocity vector is <span
    class="math inline">\(a\)</span> times the velocity vector of <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f(a[c]_p) = T_p f([\gamma]_p) = [f \circ
    \gamma]_q\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Right-hand side:</strong> We have <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p) = [f \circ c]_q\)</span>. Then
    <span class="math inline">\(aT_p f([c]_p) = a[f \circ c]_q\)</span>,
    which corresponds to a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> whose velocity vector is <span
    class="math inline">\(a\)</span> times the velocity vector of <span
    class="math inline">\(f \circ c\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, using the chain rule and local coordinates, we can show
    that the velocity vector of <span class="math inline">\(f \circ
    \gamma\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
    times the velocity vector of <span class="math inline">\(f \circ
    c\)</span>, thus demonstrating the equality <span
    class="math inline">\([f \circ \gamma]_q = a[f \circ
    c]_q\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Therefore, because <span class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span>
    preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication, it is a linear
    map. The proof relies essentially on the chain rule and the fact
    that addition and scalar multiplication of vectors are defined using
    local coordinates and are thus compatible with the equivalence
    relation defining tangent vectors as equivalence classes of
    curves.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Local Coordinates and Velocity Vectors:</strong></p>

    coordinates are:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(v_c = \frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ

    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Applying the Map <span

    rule:</p>

    <p>Yes, that’s correct for the special case where <span

    <p>In this setting:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Vectors:</strong> Tangent vectors at a point
    <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{R}^m\)</span> are simply

    <li><p><strong>Tangent Map as Jacobian:</strong> The tangent map

    entirely accurate for this specific case. It’s the simplest and most
    direct manifestation of the tangent map. The more general definition

    <p>Your argument has the right intuition, but it needs some
    refinement to be fully rigorous. The statement that “since the local
    representation is linear, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
    and the charts are arbitrary, <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pf\)</span> is also linear” is not
    sufficient on its own. Here’s why, and how we can make the argument
    sound:</p>
    <p><strong>Why your argument is incomplete:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Local vs. Global:</strong> Linearity is a global
    property. You’ve correctly shown that the <em>local
    representation</em> of the tangent map, given by <span
    class="math inline">\(D_p\tilde{f}\)</span>, is linear (because it’s
    a Jacobian matrix). However, this only shows linearity in the local
    coordinates provided by the charts. You need to demonstrate that
    this local linearity is consistent across different charts and thus
    defines a globally linear map <span class="math inline">\(T_p
    f\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Chart Dependence:</strong> The local representation
    <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> and its Jacobian
    <span class="math inline">\(D_p\tilde{f}\)</span> explicitly depend
    on the choice of charts <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((V,
    \psi)\)</span>. Different charts will yield different
    representations. You need to show that the linearity is independent
    of this choice.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How to make the argument rigorous:</strong></p>
    <p>The rigorous way to prove that <span class="math inline">\(T_p
    f\)</span> is linear is to use the definition of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> in terms of equivalence classes
    of curves, as shown before. However, we can use local
    representations to <em>inform</em> our argument and provide
    intuition about the result.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Local Linearity:</strong> You correctly established
    that <span class="math inline">\(D_p \tilde{f}\)</span> is linear.
    This means that for tangent vectors <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span> represented by vectors <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^m\)</span> using the chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(D_p \tilde{f}(\mathbf{v} +
    \mathbf{w}) = D_p \tilde{f}(\mathbf{v}) + D_p
    \tilde{f}(\mathbf{w})\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(D_p
    \tilde{f}(a\mathbf{v}) = a D_p
    \tilde{f}(\mathbf{v})\)</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Chart Transformations:</strong> Consider another pair
    of charts <span class="math inline">\((U&#39;,
    \varphi&#39;)\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\((V&#39;, \psi&#39;)\)</span> around
    <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Let <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&#39; = \psi&#39; \circ f \circ
    (\varphi&#39;)^{-1}\)</span> be the local representation using these
    new charts. Then you can show the Jacobians of <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&#39;\)</span> are related via
    appropriate change-of-coordinate matrices. The change of coordinates
    will not change the linear properties, so the linearity is preserved
    across different charts.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Global Linearity:</strong> Combining the local
    linearity and how it transforms across charts demonstrates that the
    effect of <span class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> on tangent
    vectors is independent of the local coordinate representations.
    Hence, <span class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> is indeed a linear
    transformation from <span class="math inline">\(T_p M\)</span> to
    <span class="math inline">\(T_q N\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, while your intuition about using local
    representations is correct, a fully rigorous argument requires
    demonstrating how the local linearity is preserved under chart
    transitions and implies global linearity. The detailed proof using
    equivalence classes of curves, however, remains the most direct and
    conclusive method. Your approach provides valuable intuition
    supporting that proof.</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Applying the Map <span

    <ul>
    <li><p>The image curves under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
    are <span class="math inline">\(f(c(t))\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(f(d(t))\)</span>. Their velocity vectors at

    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. Showing Equality Using the Chain Rule:</strong></p>
    <p>The curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> has

    class="math inline">\(f \circ c\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(f \circ d\)</span>. This is true because the

    differentials of the charts allow us to move between the abstract
    tangent vectors and their coordinate representations in Euclidean
    space, where the linearity of the Jacobian is easily seen.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>New Question</strong> OK. Your proof still uses local
    coordinates so you still have the question of showing local to
    global for the linearity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You are absolutely correct. My apologies; my previous
    explanations, while providing valuable intuition through local
    coordinates, did not rigorously establish the global linearity of
    the tangent map. Relying solely on local representations is
    insufficient to prove a global property like linearity. The rigorous
    proof <em>must</em> use the intrinsic definition of the tangent map
    via equivalence classes of curves, as outlined previously. My use of
    local coordinates was a heuristic aid to understand the underlying
    mechanism, but it’s not a complete proof.</p>
    <p>To reiterate the correct approach: The proof of linearity relies
    fundamentally on the definition of the tangent map <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> acting on equivalence classes
    of curves:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p) = [f \circ
    c]_{f(p)}\)</span></p>
    <p>The linearity proof is as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Preservation of Addition:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\([c]_p\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\([d]_p\)</span> be equivalence classes of
    curves in <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. We need to show
    that:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p + [d]_p) = T_p f([c]_p) +
    T_p f([d]_p)\)</span></p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be the curve
    whose equivalence class represents the sum <span
    class="math inline">\([c]_p + [d]_p\)</span>. Then, by definition of
    addition of equivalence classes of curves, we must have <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(0) = c&#39;(0) +
    d&#39;(0)\)</span> (equality of velocity vectors in any coordinate
    chart). Then:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f([c]_p + [d]_p) = T_p
    f([\gamma]_p) = [f \circ \gamma]_{f(p)}\)</span></p>
    <p>The key is that the velocity of <span class="math inline">\(f
    \circ \gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(f(p)\)</span>
    is determined solely by the velocity of <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> through the differential <span
    class="math inline">\((df)_p\)</span>. Therefore, the velocity of
    <span class="math inline">\(f \circ \gamma\)</span> is equal to the
    sum of the velocities of <span class="math inline">\(f \circ
    c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f \circ d\)</span>. This
    fact holds independently of any coordinate system.</p>
    <p>Thus, <span class="math inline">\([f \circ \gamma]_{f(p)} = [f
    \circ c]_{f(p)} + [f \circ d]_{f(p)}\)</span>, which is the
    right-hand side of the equation.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Preservation of Scalar Multiplication:</strong> The
    proof for scalar multiplication follows a similar argument. Let
    <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. We need to
    show that:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p f(a[c]_p) = aT_p

    <ol type="1">

    <li><p><strong>Dual Space:</strong> The cotangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span> is defined as the dual space
    of <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. This means it’s the
    vector space of all linear maps from <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> to the real numbers <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T_p^*M = \text{Hom}(T_pM,

    <p>In summary, the cotangent space is built by taking the dual of
    the tangent space. It’s a vector space of the same dimension as the
    tangent space, and its elements (covectors) are linear maps that act
    on tangent vectors. The differential of a function provides a
    natural way to construct covectors. The cotangent space, together
    with the tangent space, forms the foundation for the study of
    differential forms and other important objects in differential
    geometry.</p>

    tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>. Let’s break
    down what this means:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Bundle:</strong> Recall that the tangent
    bundle <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is the disjoint union
    of all tangent spaces of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>:

    More precisely, it’s the set of pairs <span

    <li><p><strong>Section of a Bundle:</strong> A section of a bundle
    is a map that assigns to each point of the base space (in this case,
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) an element in the fiber
    above that point. More formally, a section <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> is a smooth map:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X: M \to TM\)</span></p>
    <p>such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi \circ X =

    <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> is an element of the

    <li><p><strong>Smoothness:</strong> The condition that <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <em>smooth</em> map means that
    in local coordinates, the components of the vector field are smooth
    functions. Given a chart <span class="math inline">\((U,

    <p>Therefore, a vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
    on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is formally defined as a

    <p><strong>New Question</strong> For the manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> what is the set of vector fields on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>? Does it have a structure? It
    looks like a vector space to me.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The set of all smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>. It does have a
    structure, but it’s not quite a vector space in the usual sense;
    it’s more accurately described as a module over the ring of smooth
    functions <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span>. Let’s
    break down the structure:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Vector Space-like Structure:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> has operations that
    resemble vector space operations:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Addition:</strong> If <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are vector fields, then their sum
    <span class="math inline">\(X + Y\)</span> is a vector field defined
    pointwise: <span class="math inline">\((X + Y)_p = X_p +
    Y_p\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>.
    This is pointwise addition of tangent vectors.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalar Multiplication:</strong> If <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a vector field and <span
    class="math inline">\(f \in C^\infty(M)\)</span> is a smooth
    function, then <span class="math inline">\(fX\)</span> is a vector
    field defined by <span class="math inline">\((fX)_p =
    f(p)X_p\)</span>. This is scalar multiplication of a tangent vector
    by a scalar (which is the value of the function at the point
    p).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p><strong>Module Structure:</strong> The crucial difference
    from a vector space is that scalar multiplication uses elements from
    <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> (smooth functions),
    not just real numbers. This makes <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> a <em>module</em>
    over the ring <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span>.
    Modules are a generalization of vector spaces where the scalars come
    from a ring instead of a field.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Infinite Dimensionality:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> is typically
    infinite-dimensional unless <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
    itself is a zero-dimensional manifold. The space of smooth functions
    on even a small open interval in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is infinite-dimensional,
    and vector fields are constructed from these.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>
    has an algebraic structure that is similar to but richer than a
    vector space. It’s a module over <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span>, which means it’s
    equipped with addition and multiplication by smooth functions, which
    are elements of a ring instead of a field. The module structure is
    fundamental in differential geometry for understanding operations
    involving vector fields. The fact that it’s a module, rather than a
    vector space, reflects the intrinsically non-linear structure of
    manifolds.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>New Question</strong> What is a Lie bracket</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given two vector fields <span class="math inline">\(X, Y \in
    \mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> on a smooth manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, their Lie bracket, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span>, is another vector field on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. There are several ways to
    define it:</p>
    <p><strong>1. As a Derivation:</strong> The Lie bracket <span
    class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> is uniquely defined as the
    derivation that satisfies:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\([X, Y](f) = X(Y(f)) -
    Y(X(f))\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(f \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span></p>
    <p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(X(f)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(f)\)</span> denote the Lie derivatives of
    <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with respect to <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> respectively (or directional
    derivatives along <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>). The right-hand side shows that
    the Lie bracket measures the difference between the two directional
    derivatives applied in sequence. The fact that this produces a
    derivation defines the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\([X,Y]\)</span> uniquely.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Local Coordinate Expression:</strong> Let <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> be a chart on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with coordinates <span
    class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n)\)</span>. If we express the
    vector fields locally as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X = \sum_{i=1}^n X^i
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(Y
    = \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\)</span></p>
    <p>Then their Lie bracket is given by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\([X, Y] = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n
    \left( X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x^j} - Y^j \frac{\partial
    X^i}{\partial x^j} \right) \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^i}\)</span></p>
    <p>This formula is obtained by applying the definition of <span
    class="math inline">\([X,Y]\)</span> as a derivation to the
    coordinate functions <span class="math inline">\(x^i\)</span> and
    utilizing the product rule and properties of partial
    derivatives.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Geometric Interpretation:</strong> The Lie bracket
    <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> measures the “failure of
    commutativity” of the flows generated by <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. If you flow along <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for a time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and then along <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for a time <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and you do it in the reverse
    order, the difference in the final point is approximately
    proportional to <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> for
    small <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
    <p>The Lie bracket is an antisymmetric bilinear operation:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\([X, Y] = -[Y, X]\)</span> <span
    class="math inline">\([aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z]\)</span> for
    <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\)</span></p>
    <p>The Lie bracket plays a crucial role in Lie group theory, the
    study of Lie algebras (which is the vector space of vector fields
    under the Lie bracket operation), and many areas of differential
    geometry. It is a fundamental object that encodes geometric
    information about the interaction between vector fields.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>New Question</strong> <span class="math inline">\([X,
    Y]\)</span> should be an element in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>. Correct? Is the set
    of all derivations on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> the same as <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yes, <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> is indeed an
    element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>,
    meaning it’s a smooth vector field on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The Lie bracket operation takes
    two vector fields as input and produces another vector field as
    output. This is a crucial property for the structure of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> as a Lie algebra.</p>
    <p>The set of all derivations on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> is <em>not</em> the same
    as <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>. While every
    vector field defines a derivation on smooth functions (as in the
    definition of Lie derivative), not every derivation on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> corresponds to a vector
    field. Vector fields are derivations that are <em>locally</em>
    represented by partial derivative operators.</p>
    <p>Here’s why:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Vector Fields as Derivations:</strong> As mentioned
    before, any vector field <span class="math inline">\(X \in
    \mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> induces a derivation on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> through the Lie
    derivative: <span class="math inline">\(X(f) = \mathcal{L}_X
    f\)</span>. This maps a smooth function to another smooth function
    via the directional derivative along X.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Derivations That Are Not Vector Fields:</strong>
    There exist derivations on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> that cannot be expressed
    as vector fields. These derivations do not satisfy the conditions of
    being locally generated by partial derivatives. They are “global”
    derivations. They can’t be written in the form <span
    class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n X^i(p) \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^i}\Big|_p\)</span> for any smooth functions <span
    class="math inline">\(X^i\)</span> on the manifold.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tangent Vectors vs. Derivations:</strong> Every
    tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(X_p \in T_pM\)</span> is
    a derivation at the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
    However, not every derivation on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^{\infty}(M)\)</span> gives rise to a vector
    field. To be a vector field, a derivation must be locally generated
    by tangent vectors that are smoothly connected across different
    points on the manifold.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary: <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>
    is a subset of the set of all derivations on <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span>. The derivations
    corresponding to vector fields are distinguished by the condition of
    being “smoothly varying” across the manifold; in local coordinates,
    they must be expressible as a linear combination of partial
    derivative operators with smooth coefficients. The derivations that
    cannot be expressed in this local way are not vector fields.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>New Question</strong> Regarding your geometric
    interpretation of a Lie bracket, you say that “the difference in the
    final point is proportional to <span class="math inline">\([X,
    Y]\)</span>”. What do you precisely mean by difference? There is not
    yet a notion of length on the manifold.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You’re right to point out the subtlety concerning the
    “difference” in the geometric interpretation of the Lie bracket. My
    previous explanation was slightly imprecise in using the term
    “proportional” without specifying the meaning of distance or
    difference on a manifold since there’s no inherent notion of length
    without a Riemannian metric.</p>
    <p>The precise statement needs to be made in local coordinates.
    Consider two vector fields <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and their flows. The flow
    of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi_t^X\)</span>, and the flow of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi_s^Y\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Let’s examine the composition of the flows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(\phi_s^Y \circ \phi_t^X(p)\)</span>:
    Flow along <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then along <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\(\phi_t^X \circ \phi_s^Y(p)\)</span>:
    Flow along <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, then along <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The “difference” is then given by considering the difference
    between these two compositions:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\phi_s^Y \circ \phi_t^X(p) - \phi_t^X
    \circ \phi_s^Y(p)\)</span></p>
    <p>However, this difference is a <em>point</em> in the manifold, and
    the subtraction operation is not defined intrinsically on the
    manifold. We need local coordinates to quantify the difference.</p>
    <p>Using local coordinates (and ignoring higher-order terms in t and
    s which vanish as t and s go to 0), the difference is proportional
    to <span class="math inline">\([X,Y](p)\)</span> at point p. In
    local coordinates <span
    class="math inline">\((x^1,\cdots,x^n)\)</span>, the difference
    between the two points is approximated by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(t s ( [X,Y](p) )^{i}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(([X,Y](p))^{i}\)</span> is the
    i-th component of <span class="math inline">\([X,Y](p)\)</span> in
    the coordinate basis. Thus, the “difference” vector lies in the
    tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>.</p>
    <p>In summary: The “difference” isn’t a direct subtraction of points
    on the manifold (which is not generally defined), but rather a
    vector in the tangent space at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, representing the difference in the
    final positions after applying the flows in the two different
    orders. This difference vector is approximately proportional to
    <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]_p\)</span> for infinitesimally
    small times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The precise meaning is best
    captured by this approximation in local coordinates.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow on</strong> In other words, roughly, the

    <p>Yes, that’s a good way to put it. For infinitesimally small times
    <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, the difference vector resulting

    <p><strong>New Question</strong> What is a Lie algebra in the

    </blockquote>
    <p>In the context of our discussion of vector fields on a smooth
    manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, a Lie algebra is
    the set of smooth vector fields <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> equipped with the Lie
    bracket operation <span class="math inline">\([, ]\)</span>. More
    formally:</p>
    <p>A Lie algebra is a vector space <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> (over a field, usually
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> or <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>) equipped with a bilinear
    operation <span class="math inline">\([, ]: \mathfrak{g} \times
    \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}\)</span> called the Lie bracket, which
    satisfies the following properties:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Alternating (Antisymmetric):</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\([X, X] = 0\)</span> for all <span
    class="math inline">\(X \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>, which implies
    <span class="math inline">\([X, Y] = -[Y, X]\)</span> for all <span
    class="math inline">\(X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Jacobi Identity:</strong> For all <span
    class="math inline">\(X, Y, Z \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\([X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X,
    Y]] = 0\)</span></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the case of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>, the vector space
    structure comes from pointwise addition of vector fields and scalar
    multiplication by real numbers. The Lie bracket <span
    class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> is the vector field defined
    earlier. The properties of the Lie bracket for vector fields ensure
    that <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> satisfies
    the axioms of a Lie algebra.</p>
    <p>The Jacobi identity reflects a kind of higher-order associativity
    for the Lie bracket. It is a crucial condition that arises naturally
    when considering Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras. The
    Lie bracket encodes information about the infinitesimal
    transformations associated with the Lie algebra, which are essential
    to understand the structure of Lie groups.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in our discussion, the Lie algebra is the set of
    smooth vector fields on a manifold with the Lie bracket operation,
    which endows the vector space of vector fields with a rich algebraic
    structure that reflects the underlying geometry.</p>

    <p>The two structures are not mutually exclusive; they coexist.
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> is a module
    <em>and</em> a Lie algebra. The module structure allows for
    multiplication by smooth functions, while the Lie algebra structure
    provides the Lie bracket operation, which gives the set of vector
    fields its rich geometric and algebraic structure. The module
    structure is algebraic, while the Lie bracket has deep geometric
    implications concerning the flows generated by vector fields.</p>

    C^{\infty}(N)\)</span>. How can we define pullbacks and pushforwards
    of these functions.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given a smooth diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\phi: M
    \to N\)</span> between manifolds <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, we can define pullbacks and
    pushforwards for functions in <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(N)\)</span>. However, the term
    “pushforward” is less commonly used for functions than “pullback”;
    it’s more natural and frequently used to pushforward and pullback
    <em>vector fields</em>, as previously discussed. For functions, we
    typically focus on pullbacks.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Pullback of a Function:</strong></p>
    <p>The pullback of a function <span class="math inline">\(g \in
    C^\infty(N)\)</span> by the diffeomorphism <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi^*g\)</span>, is a function in <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> defined as the
    composition of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\phi^*g)(p) = g(\phi(p))\)</span>
    for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span></p>
    <p>In simpler terms, we evaluate the function <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi(p)\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to obtain the value of the
    pulled-back function <span class="math inline">\(\phi^*g\)</span> at
    the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The smoothness of <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> guarantees that <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi^*g\)</span> is also a smooth
    function.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Pushforward of a Function:</strong></p>
    <p>The pushforward of a function <span class="math inline">\(f \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi_*f\)</span>, is a function in <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(N)\)</span>. It’s defined similarly
    to the pullback but using the inverse diffeomorphism <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi^{-1}\)</span> (which exists because <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is a diffeomorphism):</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\phi_*f)(q) =
    f(\phi^{-1}(q))\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(q \in
    N\)</span></p>
    <p>Here, we evaluate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at the
    point <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{-1}(q)\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to get the value of <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi_*f\)</span> at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Again, the smoothness of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi^{-1}\)</span> guarantees that <span
    class="math inline">\(\phi_*f\)</span> is a smooth function.</p>
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The pushforward and pullback of
    functions are linear operations. If you have two functions <span
    class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, then:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\phi_*(af_1 + bf_2) = a\phi_*f_1 +
    b\phi_*f_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi^*(ag_1 +
    bg_2) = a\phi^*g_1 + b\phi^*g_2\)</span> for <span
    class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
    <p>The pullback is particularly important because it allows us to
    “transfer” functions from one manifold to another via the
    diffeomorphism, preserving the smoothness. This is a basic but
    powerful technique in differential geometry. The pushforward serves
    as the inverse operation when a diffeomorphism is available.</p>

    This is a dashed arrow to emphasize that this is not a single
    well-defined map, as there is no canonical choice of a tangent
    vector. The map implicitly associates points in <span
    class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with a tangent vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p U\)</span>, typically based on the

    class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)} V\)</span> is a subspace of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)} N\)</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This diagram shows how the smooth map <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> induces a linear map <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> between the tangent spaces at
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span

    class="math inline">\(T_p U\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)} V\)</span> are used to avoid clutter,
    showing that the tangent map acts on tangent vectors from <span
    class="math inline">\(U\)</span> that are mapped to tangent vectors
    in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The commutativity of the
    diagram is implied by the definition of the tangent map, which means
    that the action of the tangent map is consistent with the action of
    the map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> itself. More
    formally, if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a curve
    in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma(0) = p\)</span> and tangent vector
    <span class="math inline">\(v \in T_p U\)</span>, then <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p f(v)\)</span> is the tangent vector at
    <span class="math inline">\(f(p)\)</span> of the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(f \circ \gamma\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. This ensures the commutativity of
    the diagram, showing the consistency between the map <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on the manifold and its induced map
    <span class="math inline">\(T_p f\)</span> on the tangent

    <h1 id="integral-curve-to-a-vector-field">Integral Curve to a vector

    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a vector field on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. What is the definition an
    Integral curve of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a smooth vector
    field on a smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
    An integral curve of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a
    smooth curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma: I \to M\)</span>,
    where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is an open interval in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, such that the
    tangent vector to the curve at each point is equal to the value of
    the vector field at that point.</p>
    <p>More formally:</p>
    <p>A smooth curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma: I \to
    M\)</span> is an integral curve of <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> if for all <span

    <p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(t)\)</span> denotes
    the tangent vector to the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>, and <span
    class="math inline">\(X_{\gamma(t)}\)</span> is the value of the
    vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at the point
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>. In other words, the
    velocity vector of the curve at any time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> matches the vector field’s value at
    the corresponding point on the manifold.</p>
    <p><strong>Local Coordinates:</strong></p>
    <p>In local coordinates <span class="math inline">\((U,

    x^i}\)</span> and the curve as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)
    = (x^1(t), \dots, x^n(t))\)</span>, the condition for <span

    <p><strong>Existence and Uniqueness:</strong></p>
    <p>The fundamental theorem on flows guarantees the existence and
    uniqueness of integral curves for smooth vector fields. Given a
    point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, there exists a
    unique maximal integral curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p:
    I \to M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p(0) =
    p\)</span>. “Maximal” means that the interval <span
    class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the largest possible open
    interval containing 0 for which the solution exists.</p>
    <p>Integral curves are fundamental for understanding the behavior of
    vector fields. They visualize the “flow” induced by the vector
    field, with each integral curve tracing a path through <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> tangent to the vector field at
    every point. They are crucial for the definition of the flow of a
    vector field, which is a map defined from a subset of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times M\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that tells us, for any point and a
    time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the result of “flowing”
    along the vector field for the specified time. The flow is
    constructed from the integral curves.</p>

    <p>No, that’s not quite correct. My apologies for the imprecise
    wording. The coordinate functions <span
    class="math inline">\(x^i(t)\)</span> do <em>not</em> evaluate to a
    point in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Instead,

    coordinate of the point <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> <em>in the chart</em> <span

    <p>More precisely:</p>
    <ol type="1">

    <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\gamma(t))\)</span> is a

    x^n(t))\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Each <span class="math inline">\(x^i(t)\)</span> is a

    <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\gamma(t)) \in

    </ol>
    <p>So, the <em>tuple</em> <span class="math inline">\((x^1(t),

    each individual <span class="math inline">\(x^i(t)\)</span> is just
    a real number, the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th
    coordinate of the image of the point <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> under the chart map <span

    Theorem on Flows” or the “Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for
    Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)” when applied to
    manifolds.</p>
    <p><strong>Theorem (Existence and Uniqueness of Integral
    Curves):</strong></p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth manifold
    and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a smooth vector field
    on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. For each point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, there exists a unique
    maximal integral curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p: I_p \to
    M\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_p(0) = p\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span> is an open interval in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> containing 0. “Maximal”
    means that <span class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span> is the largest
    possible open interval for which the solution exists.</p>
    <p><strong>Proof Outline:</strong></p>
    <p>The proof relies on the corresponding existence and uniqueness
    theorem for ODEs in Euclidean space and uses charts to transfer the
    result to manifolds.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Local Existence and Uniqueness:</strong> Choose a
    chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> around <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi(p) = 0\)</span> (we can always shift
    the coordinates to achieve this). In these local coordinates, the
    vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be expressed
    as <span class="math inline">\(X = \sum_{i=1}^n X^i
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(X^i\)</span> are smooth functions on <span
    class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The condition for a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> to be an integral curve
    becomes a system of first-order ODEs:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dx^i}{dt} = X^i(x^1(t), \dots,
    x^n(t))\)</span>, with initial condition <span
    class="math inline">\(x^i(0) = 0\)</span> (since <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi(p) = 0\)</span>).</p>
    <p>The standard Picard-Lindelöf theorem for ODEs in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> guarantees the existence
    and uniqueness of a solution to this system on some interval <span
    class="math inline">\((-\epsilon, \epsilon)\)</span> for some <span
    class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>. This gives us a
    local integral curve in the chart.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Transfer to Manifold:</strong> Using the chart map
    <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{-1}\)</span>, we can map the
    solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> back
    to the manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, obtaining a
    local integral curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma: (-\epsilon,
    \epsilon) \to M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0)
    = p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Maximality and Uniqueness:</strong> To obtain a
    maximal integral curve, we can extend the interval of definition.
    Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> are two integral curves with
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1(0) = \gamma_2(0) = p\)</span>.
    By local uniqueness within a chart, they must agree on the
    intersection of their intervals of definition. The maximal integral
    curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p: I_p \to M\)</span> is
    then obtained by taking the union of the intervals of definition of
    all integral curves through p. The uniqueness follows from the local
    uniqueness in charts and patching the solutions together. The
    maximal interval of existence, <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span>, is open by
    construction.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>This proof outline provides the key ideas. The technical details
    involve carefully patching together local solutions and handling the
    transition between different charts using the smooth structure of
    the manifold. The Picard-Lindelöf theorem for ODEs provides the
    foundation for the local existence and uniqueness. Extending this to
    global existence and uniqueness requires some technical machinery
    from analysis.</p>
    <h1 id="flow-of-a-vector-field">Flow of a vector field</h1>
    <p><strong>New Question: What is the formal definition of the flow
    of a vector field? And what is the connection with integral
    curves?</strong></p>
    <p>The flow of a vector field formalizes the idea of “flowing along”
    the vector field for a certain amount of time. It’s intimately
    connected to integral curves.</p>
    <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong></p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a smooth vector
    field on a smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
    The flow of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a smooth
    map:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi: \mathcal{D} \to M\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> is an open
    subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times M\)</span>
    defined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D} = \{(t, p) \in
    \mathbb{R} \times M \,|\, t \in I_p \}\)</span>, and <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span> is the maximal interval of
    existence for the integral curve through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The flow <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> satisfies the following
    properties:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi(0, p) = p\)</span> for all
    <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>. (Starting at <span
    class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> leaves the point
    unchanged).</p></li>
    <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi(s, \Phi(t, p)) = \Phi(s + t,
    p)\)</span> whenever both sides are defined. (Flowing for time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and then for time <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the same as flowing for time
    <span class="math inline">\(s+t\)</span>). This is often referred to
    as the <em>group property</em> or the <em>flow
    property</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p>For fixed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the curve
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p(t) = \Phi(t, p)\)</span> is the
    unique maximal integral curve of <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> starting at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Connection with Integral Curves:</strong></p>
    <p>The connection between the flow and integral curves is
    fundamental:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Integral curves define the flow:</strong> The flow
    <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> is defined by
    “flowing” the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> along the
    integral curve of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that passes
    through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for a time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Each integral curve is a “slice”
    of the flow for a fixed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. In
    other words, fixing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the
    flow gives the integral curve <span
    class="math inline">\(\gamma_p(t) = \Phi(t,p)\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>The flow consists of integral curves:</strong> The
    flow can be thought of as a collection of all integral curves of
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For each <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(\cdot, p)\)</span> is the maximal
    integral curve starting at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>The flow determines the vector field:</strong>
    Conversely, given the flow <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be recovered by differentiating
    the flow with respect to time at <span
    class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(X_p = \frac{d}{dt}\Phi(t,
    p)\Big|_{t=0}\)</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In essence, the flow provides a global picture of how points on
    the manifold move under the influence of the vector field. Each
    integral curve gives a local trajectory of a point, and the flow
    pieces them all together. The flow is a smooth map capturing the
    combined dynamics of all integral curves. The existence and
    uniqueness of integral curves imply the existence and uniqueness of
    the flow.</p>
    <p><strong>Follow on Question</strong> Given a <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t,p)\)</span>, if we fix <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then for a non zero and small
    value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t,p)\)</span> gives another point on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> near <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Is this what is meant by
    ``flowing’’ through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>? If so,
    how large can <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be?</p>
    <p>Yes, you’ve got the right idea. “Flowing” along the vector field
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> through a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> means tracing the integral curve of
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that passes through <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> gives the point you reach
    after “flowing” for a time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
    along the vector field, starting at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. For small, non-zero values of
    <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> will indeed be a point
    near <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the manifold.</p>
    <p>How large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be depends
    on the maximal interval of existence <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span> for the integral curve through
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This interval can be:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>The entire real line:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p = (-\infty, \infty)\)</span>. In this
    case, the integral curve is defined for all times, and you can flow
    forward and backward indefinitely. The vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be
    <em>complete</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A finite interval:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p = (a, b)\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(a &lt; 0 &lt; b\)</span>. Here, the integral
    curve is only defined for a limited time. You can flow forward up to
    time <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and backward up to time
    <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, but not beyond those limits.
    This is typical of incomplete vector fields.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A semi-infinite interval:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p = (a, \infty)\)</span> or <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p = (-\infty, b)\)</span>. Here, you can
    flow indefinitely in one direction but not the other.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The size of <span class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span> depends on
    the behavior of the vector field. For example, if the vector field
    “grows too fast,” the integral curves might “blow up” in finite
    time, leading to a finite interval of existence.</p>
    <p>In summary, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> gives
    the point reached after flowing for a time <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> from <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. For small <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, this point will be near <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The largest value <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can take is determined by the
    maximal interval of existence <span
    class="math inline">\(I_p\)</span>, and can be a finite or infinite
    interval based on the behavior of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> itself.</p>

    <p><strong>New Question Previously we discussed the Lie derivative

    meaning of the directional derivative of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> evaluated at a given <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Is there another characterization
    of the Lie derivative using the associated flow <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t,p)\)</span>?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, there is another, very important characterization of the Lie
    derivative of a smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span> with respect to a vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> using the flow <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> generated by <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition using the flow:</strong></p>
    <p>The Lie derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with
    respect to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be defined
    as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) = \lim_{t \to 0}
    \frac{f(\Phi(t, p)) - f(p)}{t} = \frac{d}{dt} f(\Phi(t,
    p))\Big|_{t=0}\)</span></p>
    <p>This definition has a clear geometric interpretation:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Flow along X:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> is the point you reach by
    starting at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and “flowing”
    along the vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for a
    time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Change in f:</strong> <span
    class="math inline">\(f(\Phi(t, p)) - f(p)\)</span> is the change in
    the value of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as you move from
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi(t, p)\)</span> along the flow.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rate of Change:</strong> Dividing by <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and taking the limit as <span
    class="math inline">\(t \to 0\)</span> gives the instantaneous rate
    of change of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along the flow
    of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is exactly the directional
    derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the
    direction of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Equivalence with the derivation definition:</strong></p>
    <p>This definition is equivalent to the previous definition of the
    Lie derivative as a derivation:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) =
    X_p(f)\)</span></p>
    <p>The equivalence can be shown using the chain rule and the
    definition of the vector field in terms of its flow:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt} f(\Phi(t, p))\Big|_{t=0}
    = df_p \left( \frac{d}{dt}\Phi(t, p)\Big|_{t=0} \right) = df_p(X_p)
    = X_p(f)\)</span></p>
    <p>The flow-based definition provides a more geometric and intuitive
    understanding of the Lie derivative. It shows how the Lie derivative
    measures the rate of change of a function as you “flow” along the
    vector field. This definition is also often easier to compute in
    practice when the flow of the vector field is known.</p>

    <p><strong>Given <span class="math inline">\(X,Y \in

    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with respect to <span

    <p>Yes, there is a notion of the Lie derivative of a vector field
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with respect to another
    vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_X Y\)</span>. This is also known
    as the Lie bracket of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and it’s a fundamental
    operation in differential geometry. It measures how the vector field
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> changes along the flow of
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
    <p>There are several equivalent ways to define the Lie derivative of
    a vector field:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Using flows:</strong></p>
    <p>Perhaps the most geometrically intuitive definition uses the
    flows of the vector fields. Let <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_t\)</span> be the flow of <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Then the Lie derivative of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with respect to <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is defined as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{L}_X Y)_p = \lim_{t \to 0}
    \frac{(\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}) - Y_p}{t} = \frac{d}{dt}
    (\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)})\Big|_{t=0}\)</span></p>
    <p>Here, <span class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> is the
    pushforward (differential, or tangent map) of the flow <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_{-t}\)</span>. This definition captures
    the idea of comparing <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at a
    point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with the “pulled back”
    value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> from a nearby point
    along the flow of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>2. As a derivation:</strong></p>
    <p>Equivalently, and often more practically useful, the Lie
    derivative of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with respect to
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be defined as the Lie
    bracket <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span>, which is a new
    vector field defined by its action on smooth functions:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X, Y]\)</span>
    <span class="math inline">\([X, Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))\)</span>
    for all <span class="math inline">\(f \in C^\infty(M)\)</span></p>
    <p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(X(f)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(f)\)</span> denote the Lie derivatives of
    the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with respect to
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, respectively (which are just
    directional derivatives).</p>
    <p><strong>3. In local coordinates:</strong></p>
    <p>In local coordinates, if <span class="math inline">\(X = \sum_i
    X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y = \sum_j Y^j \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^j}\)</span>, the Lie bracket is given by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\([X, Y] = \sum_{i,j} \left( X^i
    \frac{\partial Y^j}{\partial x^i} - Y^i \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial
    x^i} \right) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\)</span></p>
    <p>The Lie derivative (or Lie bracket) of vector fields plays a
    central role in differential geometry, particularly in the study of
    Lie groups and Lie algebras. It provides a way to measure how vector
    fields change along the flow of other vector fields and quantifies
    the non-commutativity of their flows. It is a fundamental operation
    capturing the interaction between vector fields.</p>

    <p>You’re right to question the connection between the informal
    “flow then reverse” description and the formal definition of the Lie
    derivative using flows. Let’s break down the geometric intuition and
    how it relates to the formal definition.</p>
    <p><strong>Informal Intuition:</strong></p>
    <p>The informal description suggests the following procedure:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Start at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Flow along the vector field <span

    class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, reaching a point <span
    class="math inline">\(q = \Phi^Y_\epsilon(p)\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi^Y\)</span> denotes the flow of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Flow from <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> along the
    vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for a small time
    <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, reaching a point
    <span class="math inline">\(r = \Phi^X_\epsilon(q) =
    \Phi^X_\epsilon(\Phi^Y_\epsilon(p))\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Now reverse the order: flow along <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and then along <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for time <span
    class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, reaching a point <span
    class="math inline">\(r&#39; =

    <li><p>The difference between <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span> is related to the

    </ol>
    <p><strong>Connecting to the Formal Definition:</strong></p>
    <p>The formal definition using flows was given as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{L}_X Y)_p = \lim_{t \to 0}
    \frac{(\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}) - Y_p}{t}\)</span></p>
    <p>Here’s how it relates to the intuitive picture:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi_t(p)\)</span>: This is the

    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><span class="math inline">\(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}\)</span>: This is
    the vector field <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> evaluated at
    the point <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_t(p)\)</span>. So, we’ve
    moved a little bit along <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
    are now looking at the vector <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
    at the new location.</p></li>
    <li><p><span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)})\)</span>: This is
    where the crucial “pullback” happens. The pushforward <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> takes the vector <span
    class="math inline">\(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}\)</span> and “transports” it
    back to the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
    We are essentially “comparing” <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at the new location to the original
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is done by “moving” <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (forward), then back to <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by “moving backward” again along
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Difference and Limit: The expression <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}) - Y_p\)</span>
    measures the difference between the transported <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and the original <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Dividing by <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and taking the limit gives the
    <em>rate of change</em> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
    along the flow of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The key point is that <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> effectively performs
    the “reverse flow” along <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
    that’s implied in the informal description. It allows us to compare
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at different points along the
    flow of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by bringing them back
    to a common tangent space (the one at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). The limit then extracts the
    first-order change, capturing the essence of the Lie derivative as a
    rate of change.</p>
    <p>It’s important to remember that while the informal description
    gives good intuition, it’s not a precise definition because it
    involves small but finite steps. The formal definition using the
    limit captures this intuition precisely and makes it rigorous. The
    difference between the informal and formal definition is crucial
    because the Lie derivative, as defined with the limit, is a
    first-order approximation. The higher order terms would not be
    relevant.</p>
    <p><strong>Follow on Question: Your explanation is helpful. the
    pullback <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)})\)</span> is very
    clear. You call the term <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_{*}\)</span> a “pushforward” which
    seems oxymoronic - a pushforward to achieve a pullback. The formal
    Definition you provide is very clear though</strong></p>
    <p>You’re absolutely right to point out the apparent contradiction
    in terms. My apologies for the confusing terminology. The term
    “pushforward” is standard, but in this context, it can be
    misleading. Let me clarify:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Pushforward (General):</strong> In general, for a
    smooth map <span class="math inline">\(f: M \to N\)</span>, the
    <em>pushforward</em> <span class="math inline">\(f_*\)</span> (also
    sometimes denoted <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> or <span
    class="math inline">\(Tf\)</span>) maps tangent vectors
    <em>forward</em> from <span class="math inline">\(T_p M\)</span> to
    <span class="math inline">\(T_{f(p)} N\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Pullback (of a vector field):</strong> What we’re
    doing with <span class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> is, in
    effect, a <em>pullback</em> of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We’re taking the value of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_t(p)\)</span> and “pulling it back” to
    the tangent space at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Why the “Pushforward” term is used:</strong> Even
    though we’re effectively pulling back <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the map <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> itself is still
    technically a <em>pushforward</em> because <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_{-t}\)</span> maps from <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. So, <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*\)</span> maps tangent vectors
    <em>forward</em> along the flow of <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_{-t}\)</span>. It just so happens that in
    the definition of the Lie derivative, we’re using this pushforward
    to achieve the effect of a pullback of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better Terminology:</strong></p>
    <p>To avoid confusion, it might be more accurate to say that <span
    class="math inline">\((\Phi_{-t})_*(Y_{\Phi_t(p)})\)</span> is the
    “transport” of <span class="math inline">\(Y_{\Phi_t(p)}\)</span>
    back to <span class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> along the flow of
    <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Or, we are “pushing forward
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_t\)</span> then pulling it back along
    <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{-t}\)</span>”. This emphasizes
    that we’re moving a vector from one tangent space to another.</p>
    <p>The key takeaway is to understand the geometric operation: We are
    comparing the vector field <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at
    different points along the flow of <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by “transporting” or “pulling back”
    the vectors to a common tangent space, then measuring the
    difference. Using clearer language like “transport” helps avoid the
    potential confusion caused by the term “pushforward” in this
    specific context. The “pushforward of Y along <span
    class="math inline">\(\Phi_t\)</span> then pulling it back along
    <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{-t}\)</span>” might be a better
    intuitive explanation.</p>

    </ol>
    <p><strong>Formal Proof:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Local Coordinates and Assumptions:</strong> Choose a

    <p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi^V_t(x) = x + t V(x) +

    <p>Continuing this process for the reverse flows, and after a

    <p>Yes, that’s correct. The flow <span

    the values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for which the

    class="math inline">\(V(V(x_0))\)</span>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher-order derivatives:</strong> Higher-order
    derivatives can be computed recursively by repeatedly
    differentiating the ODE, involving higher-order partial derivatives
    of the <span class="math inline">\(V^i\)</span> functions and more
    applications of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as a derivation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Taylor Expansion up to Second Order:</strong></p>
    <p>Combining the derivatives, the Taylor expansion up to second
    order is:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(x^i(t) = x_0^i + t V^i(x_0) +
    \frac{t^2}{2} V(V^i)(x_0) + \mathcal{O}(t^3)\)</span></p>
    <p>This can be written more compactly using the vector notation
    (recalling that <span class="math inline">\(x_0 =
    \varphi(p)\)</span>):</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(x(t) = x_0 + t V(x_0) + \frac{t^2}{2}
    V(V(x_0)) + \mathcal{O}(t^3)\)</span></p>
    <p>Finally, using the inverse chart map to get back to the manifold
    M:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi^V(t,p) = \varphi^{-1}\left( x_0
    + t V(x_0) + \frac{t^2}{2} V(V(x_0)) + \mathcal{O}(t^3)
    \right)\)</span></p>
    <p>This shows how to obtain the Taylor expansion up to second order.
    The higher-order terms become increasingly complex but follow a
    similar pattern involving higher-order derivatives of the component
    functions of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.</p>

    <p><strong>What is a 1-form defined on the manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span></strong></p>
    <p>A 1-form on a smooth manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a smooth section of the
    cotangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(T^*M\)</span>. Let’s
    break down what this means:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Cotangent Bundle:</strong> The cotangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(T^*M\)</span> is the disjoint union of all
    cotangent spaces of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: <span
    class="math inline">\(T^*M = \bigcup_{p \in M} T_p^*M\)</span>. More
    precisely, it’s the set of all pairs <span class="math inline">\((p,
    \omega_p)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p \in
    T_p^*M\)</span> is a covector (one-form) at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. It has a natural projection map
    <span class="math inline">\(\pi: T^*M \to M\)</span> such that <span
    class="math inline">\(\pi(p, \omega_p) = p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Section of a Bundle:</strong> A section of a bundle
    is a map that assigns to each point of the base space (in this case,
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) an element in the fiber
    above that point. More formally, a 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is a smooth map:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\omega: M \to T^*M\)</span></p>
    <p>such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi \circ \omega =
    \text{id}_M\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(\text{id}_M\)</span> is the identity map on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. This condition means that
    for each <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, the covector
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega(p)\)</span> is an element of the
    cotangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span>. In
    other words, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> assigns a
    covector to each point of the manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smoothness:</strong> The condition that <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is a <em>smooth</em> map means
    that in local coordinates, the components of the 1-form are smooth
    functions. Given a chart <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we can
    write <span class="math inline">\(\omega(p) = \sum_{i=1}^n
    \omega_i(p) dx^i|_p\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_i(p)\)</span> are real numbers
    representing the components of <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega(p)\)</span> in the coordinate basis
    <span class="math inline">\(\{dx^1|_p, \dots, dx^n|_p\}\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i: U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> are
    smooth functions.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>In simpler terms:</strong></p>
    <p>At each point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the
    manifold, a 1-form <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>
    assigns a linear functional <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p:
    T_pM \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> to the tangent space at that point.
    This linear functional takes a tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> as input and gives a real number
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p(v_p)\)</span> as output. The
    smoothness condition ensures that this assignment varies smoothly as
    the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> moves across the
    manifold. The one form acts on a vector field to produce a smooth
    function.</p>
    <p>Therefore, a 1-form <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>
    on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is formally defined as a
    smooth section of the cotangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(T^*M\)</span>. This means it’s a smooth map
    that assigns a covector <span class="math inline">\(\omega(p) \in
    T_p^*M\)</span> to each point <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    M\)</span>. The smoothness condition ensures that the 1-form varies
    smoothly across the manifold. One forms are also referred to as
    differential one forms.</p>
    <p><strong>At a point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>,
    using a chart <span class="math inline">\((U,\varphi)\)</span>, how
    to show that <span class="math inline">\(\{dx^1 |_p, \cdots, dx^n
    |_p\}\)</span> is the coordinate basis for <span
    class="math inline">\(T^*_pM\)</span></strong></p>
    <p>To show that <span class="math inline">\(\{dx^1|_p, \dots,

    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> given a chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>, we need to demonstrate
    that these one-forms are linearly independent and span <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span>. Let’s use the properties of
    the dual basis.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Coordinate Basis for <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>:</strong> The chart <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> provides a coordinate
    system <span class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n)\)</span> on
    <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The partial derivative
    operators at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^1}\Big|_p, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\Big|_p
    \right\}\)</span></p>
    <p>form a basis for the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. These are derivations that act
    on smooth functions <span class="math inline">\(f \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Definition of <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span>:</strong> The one-forms <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span> are defined by their action
    on the basis vectors of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p \left(
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\Big|_p \right) =
    \delta^i_j\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\delta^i_j\)</span> is the
    Kronecker delta (1 if <span class="math inline">\(i=j\)</span>, 0
    otherwise).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Linear Independence:</strong> Suppose we have a
    linear combination of the <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span> that equals the zero
    covector:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i dx^i|_p =
    0\)</span></p>
    <p>This means that for every tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p \in T_pM\)</span>, we have <span
    class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i dx^i|_p(v_p) = 0\)</span>.
    Applying this equation to the basis vectors <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}|_p\)</span>, and
    using the definition of <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span>, we get:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i dx^i|_p \left(
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\Big|_p \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i
    \delta^i_j = a_j = 0\)</span></p>
    <p>This is true for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>,
    proving that the <span class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span> are
    linearly independent.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Spanning <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span>:</strong> Any covector <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p \in T_p^*M\)</span> can be expressed
    as a linear combination of the <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_p
    \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p \right)
    dx^i|_p\)</span></p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_i = \omega_p \left(
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_p \right)\)</span>. Then <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i dx^i|_p\)</span>.
    This shows that the <span class="math inline">\(dx^i|_p\)</span>
    span the cotangent space.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Since the one-forms <span class="math inline">\(\{dx^1|_p, \dots,
    dx^n|_p\}\)</span> are linearly independent and span <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p^*M\)</span>, they form a basis for the
    cotangent space at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, which is
    called the coordinate basis (also the dual basis) for the cotangent
    space, given the chart <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span>. The dual basis property is crucial to this proof.
    The proof relies on selecting basis vectors of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span> and demonstrating the dual basis
    relationship with <span class="math inline">\(\{dx^1|_p, \dots,
    dx^n|_p\}\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there other ways to view the 1-form in addition to as
    a map <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p: T_pM \to
    R\)</span>?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, there are several other ways to view a 1-form, depending on
    the context and what aspects you want to emphasize:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>As a Covector:</strong> A 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> assigns a covector <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span> to each point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the manifold, meaning it is a
    linear map <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p: T_p M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span>. This is the most fundamental perspective. The
    linear map takes a tangent vector and returns a real
    number.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>As a Linear Functional on Tangent Vectors:</strong>
    This is closely related to the covector perspective but emphasizes
    the action of the 1-form on tangent vectors. The 1-form acts as a
    linear functional, assigning a real number (a scalar) to each
    tangent vector at a point on the manifold. This number represents
    the “projection” of the vector onto the 1-form.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Locally as a Differential:</strong> In local
    coordinates <span class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n)\)</span>
    given by a chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span>
    around a point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, a 1-form
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> can be written locally
    as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i(x)
    dx^i\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i(x)\)</span> are smooth
    functions. In this local representation, the <span
    class="math inline">\(dx^i\)</span> are the differentials of the
    coordinate functions. This viewpoint emphasizes the local coordinate
    representation and the connection to calculus (the
    differential).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>As a Section of the Cotangent Bundle:</strong> As
    previously discussed, a 1-form is a smooth section of the cotangent
    bundle <span class="math inline">\(T^*M\)</span>. This perspective
    emphasizes the global aspect of the 1-form, considering it as a
    smooth assignment of a covector to each point of the
    manifold.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>As a Linear Map on Vector Fields:</strong> A 1-form
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> acts not just on
    individual tangent vectors but also on vector fields <span
    class="math inline">\(X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span>. This action
    produces a smooth function: <span class="math inline">\(\omega(X): M
    \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> which at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is given by <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p(X_p)\)</span>. This viewpoint
    emphasizes the action of the 1-form as a global linear operator on
    the module of vector fields. This results in a smooth function on
    <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Using the Interior Product:</strong> The interior
    product <span class="math inline">\(i_X \omega\)</span> of a vector
    field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with a 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> produces a function on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> whose value at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p(X_p)\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The choice of viewpoint often depends on the context. The
    covector perspective is often most useful for the theoretical
    development, while the local differential representation is more
    useful for computational purposes. The linear functional perspective
    emphasizes the action on vectors while the section of the cotangent
    bundle emphasizes the global aspect of a 1-form. The linear map on
    vector fields emphasizes the properties of the one-form acting as a
    global operator. The interior product representation emphasizes the
    relationship between the one-form and vector fields.</p>
    <p><strong>The view that a 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> can be viewed as producing a
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega(X): M \to R\)</span> where <span
    class="math inline">\(X \in \mathfrak(X)\)</span> needs more
    detailed explanation. It appears that <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega(X)\)</span> is a <span
    class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> function.</strong></p>
    <p>You’re right to ask for a more detailed explanation. The action
    of a 1-form <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> on a vector
    field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> does indeed produce a
    smooth function <span class="math inline">\(\omega(X) \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span>. Let’s break down how this works:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>1-form at a point:</strong> At each point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>, the 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> assigns a covector <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p \in T_p^*M\)</span>. Recall that a
    covector at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a linear map
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p: T_p M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Vector field at a point:</strong> The vector field
    <span class="math inline">\(X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)\)</span> assigns a
    tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(X_p \in T_p M\)</span> to
    each point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Action at a point:</strong> We can apply the covector
    <span class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span> to the tangent vector
    <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span>: <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p(X_p) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. This
    produces a real number representing the value of the 1-form acting
    on the vector field at the specific point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is sometimes denoted as <span
    class="math inline">\(i_X \omega\)</span>, which is the interior
    product. This is a function on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> evaluated at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smooth Function:</strong> Now, let’s consider how
    this real number changes as we vary the point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> across the manifold. The smooth
    conditions on the 1-form <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>
    (meaning the coordinate functions of <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> are smooth) and the vector
    field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (smoothness of its
    coordinate functions) ensure that the function <span
    class="math inline">\(p \mapsto \omega_p(X_p)\)</span> is smooth. In
    other words, this produces a smooth real valued function on the
    manifold. This is the function <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega(X)\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Global Action:</strong> Thus, the 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> acts on the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to produce a smooth function <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega(X): M \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. This
    function <span class="math inline">\(\omega(X) \in
    C^\infty(M)\)</span> is defined pointwise by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\omega(X))(p) =
    \omega_p(X_p)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    M\)</span>.</p>
    <p>This action can be viewed as a global linear operator.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>In local coordinates:</strong></p>
    <p>Suppose we have a chart <span class="math inline">\((U,
    \varphi)\)</span> with coordinates <span class="math inline">\((x^1,
    \dots, x^n)\)</span>. Then, locally:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i(x)
    dx^i\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(X = \sum_{j=1}^n X^j(x)
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i(x)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(X^j(x)\)</span> are smooth functions. The
    action of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> on <span
    class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\omega(X) = \omega(X)(x) = \left(
    \sum_i \omega_i(x) dx^i \right) \left( \sum_j X^j(x)
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i(x)
    X^i(x)\)</span></p>
    <p>This is clearly a smooth function of the local coordinates,
    demonstrating the smoothness of <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega(X)\)</span>. This is also written as
    <span class="math inline">\(i_X \omega\)</span>.</p>
    <p>This emphasizes the duality between 1-forms and vector fields.
    The 1-form acts on vector fields to produce a smooth function, which
    captures how the 1-form measures the component of vector fields
    along its direction at each point. This is a linear map between the
    module of vector fields and the space of smooth functions on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
    <h1 id="geometric-intuition-of-1-forms">Geometric Intuition of
    1-forms</h1>
    <p><strong>Provide geometric intuition for a 1-form just like there
    is one for tangent vectors at a point <span class="math inline">\(p
    \in M\)</span>.</strong></p>
    <p>The geometric intuition for a 1-form at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> is less immediate than that
    for tangent vectors, but we can develop it by considering its action
    on tangent vectors. While tangent vectors represent directions and
    magnitudes of movement <em>along</em> the manifold, 1-forms
    represent a way to measure or assign a value to those directions.
    Think of it like this:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Level Sets:</strong> Imagine a smooth function <span
    class="math inline">\(f: M \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. The level sets
    of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (the sets of points where
    <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> takes on a constant value)
    form surfaces (or hypersurfaces) in <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The differential <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> at a point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a 1-form. The vector <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> is normal to the level set at
    point p. This is only true if the gradient is non zero.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Geometrically, <span class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> assigns
    to each tangent vector at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> a
    measure of how much that vector points in the direction of
    increasing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. If the vector is
    tangent to a level set, its value is zero. The value increases as
    the vector points more in the direction normal to the level set of
    <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Measuring “Flow”:</strong> Consider a 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and imagine a small tangent vector
    <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The value <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p(v_p)\)</span> can be interpreted as a
    measure of the “flow” or “flux” through a small surface element
    oriented in the direction <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>.
    The 1-form <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> determines a
    magnitude (and sign). The magnitude represents the amount of “flow”
    through the element, and the sign tells us the direction of the flow
    relative to the 1-form. The magnitude is related to the component of
    the vector along the 1-form.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Dual to Tangent Vectors:</strong> The value <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p(v_p)\)</span> can also be viewed as
    the “projection” of the tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> onto the 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span>, analogous to the dot
    product in Euclidean space.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Linear Functional:</strong> Recall that a 1-form <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span> is a linear functional on
    tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. It takes
    tangent vectors as input and returns a real number, measuring their
    components along a direction determined by <span
    class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span>. The real number output is a
    linear function of the input tangent vectors.</p>
    <p>In essence, a 1-form at a point can be geometrically viewed as a
    way to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Measure the component of a tangent vector in a specific
    direction (related to <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span>).</li>
    <li>Measure the “flow” or “flux” through an infinitesimal surface
    element (related to the surface integral).</li>
    <li>Assign a scalar value to tangent vectors via a linear
    functional.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These interpretations help visualize 1-forms and understand their
    role in differential geometry. The intuitive understanding is
    improved by visualizing the level sets of functions, in the case of
    the differential of functions. For other 1-forms, the concept of
    measuring flow is important. The linear functional property is also
    crucial. The combination of these interpretations can provide a
    solid intuitive grasp of a one-form.</p>
    <p><strong>The interpretation of the 1-form in terms of level sets
    of a smooth function needs to be broken down further</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s break down the interpretation of a 1-form in terms of level
    sets of a smooth function in more detail. This interpretation is
    particularly useful for understanding the differential of a
    function, which is a 1-form.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Smooth Function and Level Sets:</strong></p>
    <p>Consider a smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f: M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span> on a manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. A level set of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a subset of <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> where <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> takes on a constant value:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(L_c = \{p \in M \,|\, f(p) =
    c\}\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(c \in
    \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
    <p>If <span class="math inline">\(df_p \neq 0\)</span>, the level
    sets of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> locally form
    hypersurfaces in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> near points
    where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not constant.</p>
    <p><strong>2. The Differential as a 1-form:</strong></p>
    <p>The differential of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at a
    point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span>, is a 1-form. It’s a linear
    map:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(df_p: T_p M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span></p>
    <p>Its action on a tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(v_p
    \in T_p M\)</span> is the directional derivative of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the direction of <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p) = v_p(f) = \lim_{t \to 0}
    \frac{f(\gamma(t)) - f(p)}{t}\)</span>,</p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> is a smooth
    curve with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0) = p\)</span> and
    <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;(0) = v_p\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Geometric Interpretation of <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> with Level Sets:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Normal to Level Sets:</strong> If <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p \neq 0\)</span>, then <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> is normal to the level set <span
    class="math inline">\(L_{f(p)}\)</span> at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is because the directional
    derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along any
    tangent vector to the level set at p must be zero. The gradient is
    orthogonal to the level surfaces.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Measuring Change Along a Direction:</strong> For a
    tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>, the value
    <span class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p)\)</span> is the rate of change
    of the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> is tangent to the
    level set at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p) = 0\)</span>, because moving along
    the level set doesn’t change the value of <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> points in the
    direction of increasing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, then
    <span class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p) &gt; 0\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> points in the
    direction of decreasing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, then
    <span class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p) &lt; 0\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>The magnitude of <span
    class="math inline">\(df_p(v_p)\)</span> is proportional to the
    component of <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> in the
    direction normal to the level set at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The magnitude is proportional to
    the cosine of the angle between the tangent vector and the
    normal.</p></li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
    <p>The differential <span class="math inline">\(df_p\)</span> is a
    1-form that measures the rate of change of the function <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span> along various directions. Its
    action on tangent vectors is intimately related to the geometry of
    the level sets of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: it’s
    normal to the level sets, and its value on a tangent vector reflects
    how much that vector points in the direction of increasing <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The magnitude of the value is the
    component of the tangent vector along the normal to the level set at
    that point. This geometric interpretation is particularly useful for
    understanding the differential 1-form in this specific case. For
    other 1-forms, other geometric interpretations are more
    appropriate.</p>
