    a curve in a manifold</h1>
    <p><strong>Let <span class="math inline">\(c: I \to M\)</span> be a
    curve, <span class="math inline">\(I \in R\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> a smooth manifold. Let <span
    class="math inline">\(Y: I \to TM\)</span> be a smooth map such that
    <span class="math inline">\(c(t) = \pi \circ Y\)</span>. We can
    compute <span class="math inline">\(dY/dt\)</span>. What is this
    object and what space does it live in?</strong></p>
    <p>The object <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span>
    represents the derivative of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. It’s not simply a tangent vector;
    it’s a vector in the tangent space of the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>, which is itself a manifold.</p>
    <p>Let’s break it down:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Curve <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and
    Vector Field <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span></strong>: We have a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(c: I \to M\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is an open interval in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a smooth manifold. The smooth
    map <span class="math inline">\(Y: I \to TM\)</span> is a vector
    field along the curve <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>,
    meaning that <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is a tangent
    vector <span class="math inline">\(Y(t) \in T_{c(t)}M\)</span> at
    each <span class="math inline">\(t \in I\)</span>. The condition
    <span class="math inline">\(c(t) = \pi \circ Y(t)\)</span> means
    that the projection of the vector field <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is the point <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> on the curve. In other words,
    the base point of the tangent vector at each point of the curve is
    the point on the curve itself.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Derivative as a Vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(TTM\)</span></strong>: The derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span> lives in the
    <em>tangent bundle of the tangent bundle</em>, denoted <span
    class="math inline">\(TTM\)</span>. More precisely, <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t) \in T_{Y(t)}(TM)\)</span>.
    This is because <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is a point
    in <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>, and the derivative of
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with respect to <span
    class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the velocity of the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TM\)</span>. The tangent bundle itself is a
    manifold, so it has a tangent space. The derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t)\)</span> is an element of the
    tangent space to the tangent bundle at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>. This is a higher order tangent
    space; it is the tangent space of the tangent bundle.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Local Coordinates:</strong> To understand this
    better, consider local coordinates. Let <span
    class="math inline">\((U, \varphi)\)</span> be a chart on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with coordinates <span
    class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n)\)</span>. The tangent bundle
    <span class="math inline">\(TM\)</span> has local coordinates <span
    class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n, v^1, \dots, v^n)\)</span>,
    where <span class="math inline">\((v^1, \dots, v^n)\)</span>
    represent the components of a tangent vector in the coordinate
    basis. Then <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> can be
    represented locally as <span class="math inline">\((x^1(t), \dots,
    x^n(t), v^1(t), \dots, v^n(t))\)</span>. The derivative is:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t) = \left(
    \frac{dx^1}{dt}(t), \dots, \frac{dx^n}{dt}(t), \frac{dv^1}{dt}(t),
    \dots, \frac{dv^n}{dt}(t) \right)\)</span></p>
    <p>Each component is a real number. This is a tangent vector in
    <span class="math inline">\(T_{Y(t)} TM\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Connection:</strong> The derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span> can be interpreted
    using a <em>connection</em> <span
    class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The connection allows us to define
    the covariant derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\nabla_{\gamma&#39;(t)} Y(t)\)</span> which
    can be related to <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span>. However, the
    derivative itself lives in <span class="math inline">\(TTM\)</span>
    and is not simply a tangent vector on <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span> is
    a vector in the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TTM\)</span>. It represents the rate of change
    of the vector field <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along the
    curve <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, where the tangent
    vectors at each point in the curve lie on the tangent space of <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Understanding this requires
    considering the tangent bundle as a manifold in its own right and
    utilizing the concept of tangent spaces of a tangent bundle. The use
    of a connection and covariant derivative provides further insight
    into the interpretation of this object.</p>
    <h1
    id="vector-field-along-a-curve-in-euclidean-space-and-representations-in-the-canonical-basis">Vector
    field along a curve in Euclidean space and representations in the
    canonical basis</h1>
    <p><strong>Now, let <span class="math inline">\(M = E^n\)</span>. In
    this case, we get <span class="math inline">\(T_pE^n \sim
    R^n\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(TE^n = R^n \times
    R^n\)</span>. Is this correct? What would be <span
    class="math inline">\(TTE^n\)</span>?</strong></p>
    <p>You’re right that for <span class="math inline">\(M =
    \mathbb{E}^n\)</span> (Euclidean <span
    class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-space), we can identify each
    tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>
    with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> itself. This
    identification is canonical (coordinate-independent), making
    calculations simpler. However, the statement <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> requires a bit more precision.</p>
    <p><strong>Tangent Bundle of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span></strong>:</p>
    <p>It’s more accurate to say that the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is <em>isomorphic</em>
    to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, not exactly equal to it. The tangent bundle
    is defined as the set of pairs <span class="math inline">\((p,
    v_p)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    \mathbb{E}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_p \in
    T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. Since <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p\mathbb{E}^n \cong \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>,
    we can identify each pair <span class="math inline">\((p,
    v_p)\)</span> with a pair <span class="math inline">\((p, v) \in
    \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, where <span
    class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the coordinate representation of
    <span class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span>. This identification is a
    diffeomorphism and a vector bundle isomorphism, making <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
    essentially equivalent for practical purposes in terms of their
    vector bundle structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Double Tangent Bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span></strong>:</p>
    <p>The double tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is the tangent bundle
    of the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. Since <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n \cong \mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, we can think of <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> as the tangent bundle
    of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Using the same reasoning as above, <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is isomorphic to:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n)
    \times (\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n) \cong \mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \cong
    \mathbb{R}^{4n}\)</span></p>
    <p>The isomorphism arises from identifying each tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{(p, v)}(T\mathbb{E}^n)\)</span> with <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>,
    where <span class="math inline">\((p, v) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Intuitively, at each point <span
    class="math inline">\((p, v)\)</span> in the tangent bundle, we have
    a tangent space that is also <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>,
    representing the possible directions of motion both in the base
    space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and in the
    fiber <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
    <p>In summary: While <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is <em>isomorphic</em>
    to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, we should not say it is equal to it.
    Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is
    isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4n}\)</span>.
    These isomorphisms are crucial for making calculations, but one must
    keep in mind the difference between the tangent bundle as a manifold
    and its isomorphic representation as a Cartesian product.</p>
    <p><strong>Let <span class="math inline">\(c(t): I \to E^n\)</span>
    be a smooth curve and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the
    vector field on <span class="math inline">\(E^n\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span>. Is there a way to represent
    <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in terms of the canonical
    basis of <span class="math inline">\(TE^n\)</span> given the
    previous answer</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, given that <span class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n \cong
    \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, we can represent the
    vector field <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> along the
    curve <span class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> in terms of the
    canonical basis of this product space. Let’s break down how:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Curve and Vector Field:</strong> We have a smooth
    curve <span class="math inline">\(c: I \to \mathbb{E}^n\)</span>,
    where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is an open interval in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The vector field
    <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along <span
    class="math inline">\(c\)</span> assigns a tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t) \in T_{c(t)}\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> to each
    <span class="math inline">\(t \in I\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Canonical Basis of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span></strong>: The canonical basis for <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
    consists of vectors of the form <span class="math inline">\((e_i,
    0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((0, e_i)\)</span>, where
    <span class="math inline">\(e_i\)</span> is the <span
    class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th standard basis vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> (all zeros except for a
    1 in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th position). There
    are <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> such vectors.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Representing <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span>:</strong> The curve <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> can be represented in terms of
    the standard basis vectors of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(c(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n c^i(t)
    e_i\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(c^i(t)\)</span> are smooth
    functions giving the coordinates of <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Representing <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>:</strong> The tangent vector
    <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is an element of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_{c(t)}\mathbb{E}^n \cong
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. We can express <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in terms of the standard basis
    vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(Y(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i(t)
    e_i\)</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y^i(t)\)</span> are smooth
    functions giving the components of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in the standard basis.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Representation in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span></strong>: To represent <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in the canonical basis of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, we
    combine the coordinate representation of its base point <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> and its components <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(Y(t) \equiv (c(t), Y(t)) = \left(
    \sum_{i=1}^n c^i(t) e_i, \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i(t) e_i
    \right)\)</span></p>
    <p>We can write this more explicitly as a linear combination of the
    basis vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(Y(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n c^i(t) (e_i, 0) +
    \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i(t) (0, e_i)\)</span></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>This shows how to express <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in terms of the canonical basis
    of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times
    \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. The representation uses the coordinate
    functions of both the base point of the tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> and the components of the
    tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>. The
    components <span class="math inline">\(c^i(t)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(Y^i(t)\)</span> are scalar valued smooth
    functions of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Given the representations above, how to represent <span
    class="math inline">\(dY / dt\)</span> which appears to be another
    vector field?</strong></p>
    <p>Given the representation of <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in the canonical basis of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
    as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(Y(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n c^i(t) (e_i, 0) +
    \sum_{i=1}^n Y^i(t) (0, e_i)\)</span></p>
    <p>we can compute the derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span> component-wise. This
    derivative will live in the tangent space of the tangent bundle
    <span class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>, which is
    isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4n}\)</span>.
    The derivative is given by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n
    \frac{dc^i}{dt}(t) (e_i, 0) + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{dY^i}{dt}(t) (0,
    e_i)\)</span></p>
    <p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Derivative of Base Point:</strong> The term <span
    class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{dc^i}{dt}(t) (e_i,
    0)\)</span> represents the derivative of the base point <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> along the curve in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. It’s a vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> representing the
    velocity of the base point <span
    class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span>. Note that we can replace <span
    class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{dc^i}{dt}(t) e_i\)</span>
    with <span class="math inline">\(c&#39;(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Derivative of Tangent Vector Components:</strong> The
    term <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{dY^i}{dt}(t) (0,
    e_i)\)</span> represents the rate of change of the components of the
    tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> as we move
    along the curve. This is another vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> that describes how the
    tangent vector itself changes.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Representation in <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span></strong>: Combining
    these, we see that <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t)\)</span> is a vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \cong
    T_{(c(t), Y(t))}(T\mathbb{E}^n)\)</span>, which represents the
    tangent space of <span class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>
    at the point <span class="math inline">\((c(t), Y(t))\)</span>.
    Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span> can be
    viewed as a vector field along the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> on <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Explicit Representation:</strong> If we consider the
    canonical basis of <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> as <span
    class="math inline">\(\{(e_i,0), (0, e_i)\}_{i=1, \dots n}\)</span>,
    we can represent <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}\)</span>
    as:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n
    \frac{dc^i}{dt}(t) (e_i, 0) + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{dY^i}{dt}(t) (0,
    e_i)\)</span></p>
    <p>This is a linear combination of the <span
    class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> basis vectors, where the
    coefficients are the time derivatives of the coordinate functions of
    the curve and of the vector field along the curve.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thus, the derivative <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dY}{dt}(t)\)</span> is represented as a
    vector in the tangent space of the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>, which is isomorphic
    to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4n}\)</span>. This shows
    explicitly how this derivative is a vector in <span
    class="math inline">\(TT\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. It can be viewed as a
    vector field along the curve <span
    class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> in the tangent bundle <span
    class="math inline">\(T\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>.</p>

    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> provides an inner
    product on each tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. If <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p, w_p \in T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> are two
    tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, their
    inner product is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\langle v_p,
    w_p \rangle\)</span>. Using the canonical identification of <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> with <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, if <span
    class="math inline">\(v = (v^1, \dots, v^n)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(w = (w^1, \dots, w^n)\)</span> are the
    coordinate representations of <span
    class="math inline">\(v_p\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span> respectively, then the inner
    product is:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\langle v_p, w_p \rangle =
    \sum_{i=1}^n v^i w^i = v \cdot w\)</span></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Riemannian Metric:</strong> A Riemannian metric <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> on a manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(M\)</span> assigns to each point <span
    class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> an inner product <span
    class="math inline">\(g_p\)</span> on the tangent space <span
    class="math inline">\(T_pM\)</span>. In the case of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>, the inner product <span
    class="math inline">\(g_p\)</span> on <span
    class="math inline">\(T_p\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> is simply the
    standard dot product inherited from <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> via the canonical
    identification. This defines the inner product at each point on the
    manifold.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Smoothness:</strong> The inner product is the
    standard dot product. Thus, it is smooth across the whole of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. Therefore the
    Riemannian metric <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is smooth
    across the manifold <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. The components of the
    metric are all constant.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Coordinate Representation:</strong> In the standard
    coordinate system of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>, the components of the
    metric tensor <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> are given
    by the Kronecker delta:</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}(p) = \delta_{ij} =
    \begin{cases} 1 &amp; i = j \\ 0 &amp; i \ne j
    \end{cases}\)</span></p>
    <p>for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{E}^n\)</span>.
    This is because it is the standard Euclidean metric on <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
    <p>In summary, the standard dot product on <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, combined with the
    canonical identification of tangent spaces with <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, provides a smooth
    Riemannian metric on <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>. This metric defines the
    concept of lengths, angles, and distances on the manifold in a
    coordinate-independent way. The Riemannian metric is the standard
    Euclidean metric in this case. The components of the metric are
    constant everywhere on the manifold. This simplicity does not occur
    on other manifolds.</p>
    <p><strong>The inner product is a real number. Why is <span
    class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> a tensor?</strong></p>
    <p>You’re right to question this; it’s a crucial point in
    understanding Riemannian geometry. The inner product <span
    class="math inline">\(\langle v_p, w_p \rangle\)</span> at a point
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is indeed a real number.
    However, the Riemannian metric <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is not just a collection of inner
    products at each point; it’s a <em>tensor field</em> that assigns an
    inner product <em>smoothly</em> to each tangent space. The <span
    class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> are the components of this
    tensor field in a coordinate system.</p>
    <p>Here’s why <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> represents
    a tensor:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Inner Product as a Bilinear Map:</strong> The inner
    product at a point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be
    viewed as a bilinear map:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(g_p: T_p M \times T_p M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span></p>
    <p>This map takes two tangent vectors as input and produces a real
    number (the inner product). This is a tensor at the point <span
    class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tensor Field:</strong> A Riemannian metric <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a smooth assignment of an inner
    product to each tangent space: <span class="math inline">\(p \mapsto
    g_p\)</span>. This is a tensor <em>field</em> because it smoothly
    assigns a tensor to each point on the manifold. Smoothness is
    essential because it guarantees the well-definedness of covariant
    differentiation and other tensor operations.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Components in a Coordinate System:</strong> In a
    local coordinate system <span class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots,
    x^n)\)</span>, the components <span
    class="math inline">\(g_{ij}(p)\)</span> represent the inner product
    of the basis vectors at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}(p) = \langle
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p, \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^j}\Big|_p \rangle\)</span></p>
    <p>These components are smooth functions of the coordinates because
    of the smoothness of the Riemannian metric. These components
    transform correctly under a change of coordinate systems (which is
    the defining property of a tensor). This transformation is a tensor
    transformation.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Tensor Transformation:</strong> Under a change of
    coordinates, the components <span
    class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> transform according to the
    tensor transformation law. This means that if we change from
    coordinates <span class="math inline">\((x^1, \dots, x^n)\)</span>
    to coordinates <span class="math inline">\((x&#39;^1, \dots,
    x&#39;^n)\)</span>, the new components <span
    class="math inline">\(g&#39;_{ij}\)</span> are related to the old
    components by:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(g&#39;_{ij} = \sum_{k, l}
    \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial x&#39;^i} \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial
    x&#39;^j} g_{kl}\)</span></p>
    <p>This transformation law is crucial; it ensures that the geometric
    quantity represented by the inner product remains the same
    regardless of the coordinate system used. It is coordinate
    independent.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In essence, while the inner product at a point is a scalar, the
    Riemannian metric is a tensor field because it assigns inner
    products smoothly across the manifold, and the components of the
    inner product transform correctly under coordinate changes. It is
    the smooth assignment of inner products to every tangent space, and
    the transformation properties of these inner products, that make it
    a tensor.</p>
    <p><strong>The inner product which is a real number is a rank-0
    tensor. So therefore, per your previous answer, this would be a
    Riemannian metric tensor. Correct?</strong></p>
    <p>No, that’s not quite correct. While the <em>value</em> of the
    inner product at a point is a scalar (a rank-0 tensor), the
    Riemannian metric itself is not a rank-0 tensor.</p>
    <p>Here’s why:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Inner product at a point:</strong> The inner product
    <span class="math inline">\(\langle v, w \rangle_p\)</span> of two
    vectors <span class="math inline">\(v, w \in T_p M\)</span> at a
    <em>specific point</em> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a
    scalar (a rank-0 tensor). This scalar depends on the point and the
    vectors.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Riemannian metric:</strong> A Riemannian metric <span
    class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a <em>tensor field</em> that
    assigns an inner product to each tangent space <em>smoothly</em>.
    This means that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> assigns a
    bilinear map <span class="math inline">\(g_p: T_p M \times T_p M \to
    \mathbb{R}\)</span> to each point <span class="math inline">\(p \in
    M\)</span>. This bilinear map is a type (0,2) tensor, not a scalar.
    It is this assignment of tensors at each point on the manifold which
    is a Riemannian metric.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Components of the metric tensor:</strong> The
    components <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}(p)\)</span> in local
    coordinates represent the inner product of the basis vectors at
    <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: <span
    class="math inline">\(g_{ij}(p) = \langle \frac{\partial}{\partial
    x^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} \rangle_p\)</span>. These are
    scalar valued functions, which vary smoothly across the manifold. It
    is the tensorial transformation property of the components that is
    important.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The crucial distinction is between the <em>value</em> of the
    inner product (a scalar) and the <em>Riemannian metric itself</em>
    (a tensor field). The Riemannian metric is a (0,2)-tensor field; its
    components are smooth functions of position on the manifold that
    transform according to the tensor transformation law. The tensor
    transformation is critical in ensuring that lengths and angles are
    consistently defined regardless of the coordinate system chosen. The
    components are scalar-valued functions that must vary smoothly. This
    collection of inner products, along with the smoothness requirement
    and tensorial transformation property of the components, define the
    Riemannian metric, which is a (0,2) tensor.</p>

    <p><span class="math inline">\(s(t) = \int_a^t ||\gamma&#39;(u)|| \,

    <p>This gives the arc length from <span

    <li><p><strong>Derivative of Arc Length:</strong> The derivative of

    </ol>
    <p>This is a strictly monotonically increasing function if the

    The inverse function is <span

    <p>The reparameterization of <span

    <p><span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}(s) =

    <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Derivative of Reparameterized Curve:</strong> To show

    Is this correct?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you’re absolutely correct. For a curve <span
    class="math inline">\(c: I \to \mathbb{E}^n\)</span> parameterized

    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> measures the rate of
    change of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, which is
    directly related to the curvature of the curve. Here’s why:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><strong>Unit Tangent Vector:</strong> Since <span
    class="math inline">\(c(s)\)</span> is parameterized by arc length,
    <span class="math inline">\(||T(s)|| = ||c&#39;(s)|| = 1\)</span>
    for all <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This means that
    <span class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> is a unit vector.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Derivative Measures Bending:</strong> The derivative
    <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> represents the
    rate at which the unit tangent vector changes as we move along the
    curve. If the curve were a straight line, the tangent vector would

    <li><p><strong>Curvature:</strong> The magnitude of <span

    <p><span class="math inline">\(\kappa(s) = \left\| \frac{dT}{ds}(s)

    <p>The curvature quantifies how much the curve bends at each point.

    the derivative is orthogonal to <span

    </ol>
    <p>In summary, your intuition is spot on. The magnitude of <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> gives the curvature
    of the curve at <span class="math inline">\(c(s)\)</span>, providing
    a quantitative measure of how much the curve is bending at that
    point. The vector <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> lies in the
    osculating plane and is orthogonal to the tangent vector, pointing
    in the direction of the curvature. It measures how much the tangent
    vector is turning per unit arc length. The norm is a measure of how
    fast the tangent vector is turning.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide a rigorous explanation of why <span
    class="math inline">\(dT/ds\)</span> is orthogonal to <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span>.</strong></p>
    <p>The rigorous explanation of why <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}\)</span> is orthogonal to <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> for a curve parameterized by arc
    length relies on the fact that <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> is a unit vector for all <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Unit Tangent Vector:</strong></p>
    <p>Since the curve <span class="math inline">\(c(s)\)</span> is
    parameterized by arc length, the tangent vector <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s) = c&#39;(s)\)</span> has unit length for
    all <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(||T(s)|| = 1\)</span> for all <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span></p>
    <p>This means that the dot product of <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> with itself is always 1:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T(s) \cdot T(s) = ||T(s)||^2 =
    1\)</span></p>
    <p><strong>2. Differentiating with Respect to <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>:</strong></p>
    <p>Now, differentiate both sides of the equation <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s) \cdot T(s) = 1\)</span> with respect to
    <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Using the product rule for
    dot products, we get:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{ds}(T(s) \cdot T(s)) =
    \frac{dT}{ds}(s) \cdot T(s) + T(s) \cdot \frac{dT}{ds}(s) = 2 \left(
    T(s) \cdot \frac{dT}{ds}(s) \right) = 0\)</span></p>
    <p>The derivative of the constant 1 is 0.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Orthogonality:</strong></p>
    <p>Since <span class="math inline">\(2 \left( T(s) \cdot
    \frac{dT}{ds}(s) \right) = 0\)</span>, we have:</p>
    <p><span class="math inline">\(T(s) \cdot \frac{dT}{ds}(s) =
    0\)</span></p>
    <p>This equation shows that the dot product of <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> is zero. By the
    definition of the dot product, this means that the vectors <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> and <span
    class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> are orthogonal
    (perpendicular) to each other for all <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
    <p>The orthogonality of <span class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\)</span> is a
    direct consequence of the fact that <span
    class="math inline">\(T(s)\)</span> has constant unit length.
    Differentiating the equation <span class="math inline">\(T(s) \cdot
    T(s) = 1\)</span> with respect to <span
    class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and applying the product rule
    immediately leads to the orthogonality condition. This is a
    fundamental result in the differential geometry of curves. The fact
    that the tangent vector has a constant length is crucial in showing
    orthogonality between the tangent and its derivative. If the length
    were not constant, then the vectors would not be orthogonal.</p>
